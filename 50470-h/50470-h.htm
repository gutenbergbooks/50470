THE GROSS ANSPACH COW</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">On</span> the evening of the twenty-third of
June, Conrad Weiser brought home, as
was his custom, the Gross Anspach cow. The
fact was, in itself, not remarkable, since it was
Conrad's chief duty to take the cow to pasture,
to guard her all day long, to lead her
from one little patch of green grass to another,
to see that she drank from one of the springs
on the hillside, and to feed her now and then
a little of the precious salt which he carried
in his pocket. What made this twenty-third
of June remarkable was the fact that this was
Conrad's final journey from the pastures of
Gross Anspach to Gross Anspach village.</p>

<p>Liesel, the property of Conrad's father,
John Conrad, was Gross Anspach's only cow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
War and the occupation of a brutal soldiery
had stripped the village of its property, its
household goods, its animals, and, alas! of
most of its young men. Gross Anspach had
hidden itself in woods and in holes in the
ground, had lived like animals in dens. Upon
the mountainside wolves had devoured children.</p>

<p>What war had left undone, famine and
pestilence and fearful cold had completed.
The fruit trees had died, the vines were now
merely stiffened and rattling stalks, and,
though it was June, the earth was bare in
many places. There were no young vines to
plant, there was no seed to sow, there were
no horses to break the soil with the plough.</p>

<p>Sometimes Conrad had company to the
hillside pasture. He was thirteen years old,
a short, sturdy, blue-eyed boy, much older
than his years, as were most of the children
in Gross Anspach. Above him in the family
were Catrina, who was married and had two
little children of her own, then Margareta,
Magdalena, and Sabina, and below him were
George Frederick, Christopher, Barbara, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
John Frederick. They all had blue eyes and
sturdy frames and they were all, except John
Frederick, thin. John Frederick was their
darling and the only partaker in the family
of the bounty of Liesel. The fact that John
Frederick had no mother seemed more terrible
than the lack of a mother for any of the other
eight children.</p>

<p>When Margareta and Magdalena and
Sabina and George Frederick and Christopher
and Barbara and John Frederick accompanied
Conrad to the hillside, they all started
soberly, the older girls knitting as they
walked, Christopher and Barbara trotting
hand in hand, and John Frederick riding upon
Conrad's back. They had little to say&mdash;there
was little to be said. When the prospect
broadened, when they were able to look out
over the walls of their own valley across the
wide landscape, then spirits were lightened
and tongues were loosed. Then they could
see other valleys and other hills and the desolation
of their own no longer filled their tired
eyes. The little children ran about, the older
ones, still working busily, sat and talked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Their speech was German, the soft and
beautiful German of the south. Sometimes
they spoke in whispers and with fearful
glances of the past and its terrors, and of the
cruel French. Sometimes the older girls
whispered together of romantic dreams which
could never come true, of true lovers and a
happy home for each. But most of all they
talked&mdash;amazing to relate&mdash;these little
Germans of two hundred years ago&mdash;of
Indians!</p>

<p>About Indians it was Conrad who had the
most to say. Conrad was the oldest boy;
though so much younger than Margareta and
Magdalena, he could read easily while they
could not read at all. While Conrad talked,
their thoughts traveled out of their poor valley,
down the great river, through strange
cities to a mighty ship upon which they
should sail and sail until they reached a Paradise.
Sometimes Conrad walked up and down
before them, his hands clasped behind his
back, sometimes he lay on the ground with
his hands under his head. He talked and
talked and let himself be questioned in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
lordly manner which lads assume with their
sisters. He carried with him always, buttoned
inside his thin clothes, a little book which he
knew by heart.</p>

<p>"Is it cold there?" asked Sabina wistfully.
Sabina was the last to recover from the fearful
winter.</p>

<p>Conrad leafed his little book.</p>

<p>"I will read. 'The climate is everywhere
subtle and penetrating. During the winter'&mdash;here,
Sabina,&mdash;'during the winter the
sun has great strength.'"</p>

<p>"I do not know what 'subtle and penetrating'
mean. Those great words are beyond
me."</p>

<p>"They mean that the climate is good,"
explained Conrad, who did not know exactly
either.</p>

<p>"Will we be hungry?" asked Sabina, still
more wistfully.</p>

<p>Conrad could hardly turn the leaves fast
enough. His eyes sparkled, his cheeks glowed.</p>

<p>"Now listen, you foolish, frightened Sabina,
listen! 'The country produces all kinds
of cereals, together with Indian corn of vari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>ous
kinds. Peas, kitchen vegetables, pumpkins,
melons, roots, hemp, flax, hops, everything.
Peaches and cherries'&mdash;Sabina, you
have never eaten peaches or cherries, but I
have eaten one of each&mdash;'peaches and cherries
grow like weeds.' Here we have nothing,
nothing! Our grandfather was a magistrate,
but we are almost beggars. My father
talks to me as he does not talk to you, Margareta
and Magdalena and Sabina and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Margareta lifted her blue eyes from her
knitting and tossed back her yellow braids.</p>

<p>"It is not very long since I spanked you
well, Conrad," said she.</p>

<p>At this all the children, even Conrad,
smiled. Margareta made a little motion as
though she meant to rise and pursue her
brother about the high tableland, Conrad
a little motion as though he dared her to a
chase. But the impulse passed, as all playful
impulses passed in this time of distress.</p>

<p>"My father talks to me because I am almost
a man," went on Conrad. "He says
that if we have another winter like the one
which is past we will all die as our mother&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Conrad could not complete his sentence. The
children did not cry, their hearts only ceased
for a moment to beat as Conrad's speech
faltered. "He says there will not be enough
animals and birds left after that time to establish
a new stock. He says that even if the
winter is mild, Gross Anspach cannot all live&mdash;even
we few that are left."</p>

<p>"But I am afraid," said little Sabina.</p>

<p>"Afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"Of the river and the great sea."</p>

<p>"Thousands have sailed down the river and
many have crossed the sea, Sabina."</p>

<p>"I am most afraid of these strange red
people."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of them," announced little
Christopher. "Not more than I am afraid of
Liesel."</p>

<p>Once more Conrad leafed his little book. It
was no wonder that it scarcely held together.</p>

<p>"They are not bad people. They fish and
hunt and plant crops. They go farther and
farther back into the woods as the white
people come. I am no more afraid of them
than I am of Christopher."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how are we to get there, brother?"
asked Magdalena, who spoke least among a
family who spoke little.</p>

<p>Conrad shut his book and tied it in its
place under his coat.</p>

<p>"That I do not know," said he impatiently.
"But we will all see yet the river and the
great sea and the deep forests and the red
people."</p>

<p>"Old Redebach says&mdash;" No sooner had
John Frederick began to speak than his lips
were covered by the hand of his brother.</p>

<p>"Old Redebach cannot tell the truth. It
is not in him. And he is afraid of everything.
Ten times he has told me that Liesel would be
carried off, that he has had a dream and has
seen men watching her. Forty times he has
told me that Liesel would die of the cattle
plague. There stands Liesel fat and hearty.
It is the schoolmaster who is to be believed
in this matter. He would start to-morrow if
he could. I tell you"&mdash;Conrad pointed toward
the declining sun&mdash;"we are going, we
are going, we are going."</p>

<p>Now, on the twenty-third of June, as Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>rad,
alone, guided the obstinate way of Liesel
through the dusk, the words of old Redebach
came back to him. Liesel had all the
trying defects of a spoiled and important
character; believing herself to be the Queen
of Gross Anspach, she expected her subjects
to follow where she led. She proceeded deliberately
into all sorts of black and shadowy
places from which Conrad did not dare
to chase her roughly for fear of affecting the
precious store of milk, upon which John
Frederick and other Gross Anspach babies
depended.</p>

<p>Conrad recalled now, besides the warnings
of old Redebach about present dangers, certain
fearful things which were printed in his
little book. The savages had learned from
the whites to be deceitful, they were frequently
drunk, they would not be governed,
they used their knives and hatchets for hideous
purposes. They were enormous creatures,
who increased their height by bunches
of towering feathers fastened to their topknots.
They stole upon their victims with
the quietness of cats, they&mdash;was that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
stealthy footstep which Conrad heard now to
the right of his path?&mdash;they celebrated their
triumph with fearful cries&mdash;what was that
strange sound which he heard to his left?</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Conrad hastened the
steps of the unruly Liesel through the twilight.</p>

<p>The Weiser family lived in one of the few
houses left in Gross Anspach. It was not
large, but to the villagers who had taken
refuge after the burning of their dwellings in
stables and sheds, it seemed like a palace.
From its doorway shone now a faint light,
at sight of which Conrad felt ashamed of his
fear. He heard the rattle of Margareta's
milk pail, and felt against his leg the warm,
comfortable body of old Wolf, the Weiser
dog.</p>

<p>"You are late," called Margareta, in an
excited tone. "I have been watching and
watching and the children have been more
than once to the bottom of the hill."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Conrad.</p>

<p>"You will hear in good time," answered
Margareta in a patronizing way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is father?"</p>

<p>"In the house."</p>

<p>"If anything had happened he would tell
me first," said Conrad. "I do not believe he
has told you anything."</p>

<p>Behind the broad table in the kitchen sat
John Conrad. He was the younger Conrad
grown old and gray with anxiety and grief.
His clothes were whole, but mended with
amazing invention. His body was still powerful
and the fire of energy flashed from his
eyes. As Conrad entered, he raised a clenched
fist and brought it down heavily upon the
table, which, solid as it was, shook under the
impact. A stranger might have thought that
he was reproving the little row of children
who sat opposite him on a bench and who
watched him with a fixed stare. But John
Conrad was a kind father; his excitement did
not find its source in anger with his children.
Nor were the children frightened. Their stare
was one of admiration and awe rather than
of fright.</p>

<p>Seeing his father thus, Conrad asked no
questions, though a dozen trembled on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
lips. He sat quietly down beside the other
children and lifted John Frederick to his
lap.</p>

<p>When Margareta came in from milking,
the family had their supper of black bread
and a little weak broth. It was enough to
keep life in their bodies, but not very vigorous
life. The children scarcely tasted what
they ate, so excited were they by their father's
appearance, and by the long and solemn
prayer with which he prefaced the meal.
Presently Elisabeth Albern came for milk
for her Eva, Michael Fuhrmann for milk for
his Balthasar, and George Reimer, the schoolmaster,
for milk for his little sister Salome.
For this milk John Conrad took no pay. He
was poor, but his neighbors were far poorer;
he regarded Liesel neither as the annoying
creature which Conrad considered her, nor as
the proud princess that she believed herself
to be, but as a sacred trust. If it were not for
Liesel half of the poor little Gross Anspach
babies would not survive the summer. Even
John Frederick was beginning to eat the
black bread and broth so that younger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
more needy babies might have his share of
Liesel's milk.</p>

<p>George Reimer spoke to John Conrad in a
way which heightened the children's excitement.</p>

<p>"I will be here," said he.</p>

<p>The children nudged one another. Their
father was the leader in what poor little affairs
Gross Anspach might still be said to
have, and he sometimes assembled his neighbors
so that they might encourage and console
one another.</p>

<p>Such a meeting was now at hand. The
older girls washed the bowls and wooden
plates and the cooking-pot and put them on
the shelf, and carried a sleepy John Frederick
and a protesting Barbara from the kitchen
and laid them firmly and tenderly in their
corner of the family bedroom. When Conrad
nodded to little Christopher that he should
follow, the older Weiser bade Christopher
stay.</p>

<p>"It is important that all my children who
can should remember this night."</p>

<p>Before long the village men and a few of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the women began to assemble. They came
quietly, with only the simplest of greetings,
but eye meeting eye said wonderful things.</p>

<p>"John Conrad Weiser, you are our leader
and friend."</p>

<p>"Neighbors, you have been my stay in
deep affliction."</p>

<p>A woman with a baby in her arms bade
John Conrad look and see how his namesake
was growing.</p>

<p>"If it were not for you he would be gone
like his father."</p>

<p>Presently the children, giving up their
places on the bench for places on little stools
or on the earthen floor, began to whisper to
one another and to point. From under the
thin and ragged coat of George Reimer, the
schoolmaster, projected a flute. George's own
flute had been taken from him by the French
soldiers, but in a few days a much finer one
had been found by the roadside, dropped,
probably, because the army could not carry
all its own possessions in addition to those
which it had stolen. It might be said that
Gross Anspach retained two valuable articles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
John Conrad Weiser's cow and George Reimer's
flute. Behind his father's back, Conrad
pretended to play a tune upon the air. At
once the solemn assembly grew a little
brighter. Last of all came Catrina and her
husband.</p>

<p>At once John Conrad rose to pray. They
still had God, these souls who had little else,
and upon Him John Conrad called, that He
might bless them in <i>a great endeavor</i>. At this,
in spite of his better knowledge, Conrad
opened his eyes and fixed them upon Margareta
until she opened hers. Conrad clasped
his hands tightly, scarcely able to breathe.</p>

<p>"Friends,"&mdash;John Conrad had closed his
prayer,&mdash;"I have asked you to come here so
that I might tell you of an important matter.
It is not necessary that in beginning what I
have to say I should remind you of our miseries
and our griefs. You know them as well
as I. You know that this life cannot go on;
that, presently, unless we do something for
ourselves, there will be none of us remaining.
Our country is desolate. The soldiers have
harried us, the great cold has tortured us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
famine has almost made an end of us. We
should not too bitterly sigh and complain on
account of what has come upon us. It may be
that thus God seeks to lead us to another and
a better land.</p>

<p>"I need not tell you, either, what land I
have in mind. We have spoken of it, we have
seen it in our dreams, we have longed for it
with all our souls. There is fertile soil, there is
temperate climate, there is, above all, thank
God! freedom and peace. There is no war
there. There&mdash;" John Conrad halted, tried
again to speak and failed.</p>

<p>"But we cannot get to that country!" cried
the young woman with the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Deep breaths
were drawn and a great sigh filled the little
room.</p>

<p>"The way has been opened," announced
John Conrad at last. "I and my family will
go to-morrow. Let those who will come with
us lift their hands."</p>

<p>But no hands were lifted. The thought of
deliverance was paralyzing.</p>

<p>"Word has come that the gracious Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of England will send us and our long-suffering
brethren to her colonies in the New World. I
have had a letter from our old neighbor the
magistrate of Oberdorf. He is in London,
awaiting the sailing of the ships. He is well
cared for; charitable persons exert themselves
for the afflicted people. Probably by this
time he is already far on his way."</p>

<p>"But <i>to-morrow</i>, father!" cried Catrina.
"Why start to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"As well to-morrow as another day," answered
John Conrad. "We have few possessions
and they are easily gathered together.
To those of our friends who will not come
with us we could not express our affection and
our farewells in a hundred days. We will go
on foot to the river and make our way to the
lowlands and thence to England. It is a long
and perilous journey, but it is not so perilous
as to stay. I cannot advise any one what to
do. But for all those who come I will care as
though they were my own."</p>

<p>"But Liesel!" cried the young woman with
the baby in her arms. "We will die without
Liesel!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>John Conrad smiled.</p>

<p>"Liesel will stay in Gross Anspach. She
will be the perpetual property of the Gross
Anspach babies."</p>

<p>George Reimer spoke next. He sat with his
arms folded across his breast, within them his
precious flute. Tears were in his eyes and in
his voice as he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh
upon me.</i>"</p>

<p>The company broke up without music.
There were those who must go home to tell
wives or mothers; there were those who
wished to talk to John Conrad in private.
There was Catrina, with her husband, weeping
and distressed, who did not dare to trust
her babies to the sea. She must plan with her
sisters the bundles which should be packed
for each to carry, the food which must be
gathered to last as long as possible. To her
and her husband John Conrad forgave a large
debt, and his kindness and their inability to
pay made the parting more heartbreaking.
John Conrad still had a little store of German
gulden, long hoarded against the coming day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>When all was done and the children were
asleep, John Conrad took his oldest son by
the hand and led him up the winding street
between the ruined houses to the little Lutheran
church which had been saved in the
great destruction. The moon shone quietly
upon it and the little walled-in space behind
it. Thither John Conrad led his son, and
beside a new-made grave they paused.</p>

<p>"It is not good to dwell on grief when one
lives in the world and has still the work of half
a lifetime," said he solemnly. "But there are
moments when it is right that we should yield
ourselves to our sorrow. The others will come
here in the morning, but you and I will then
have no time for shedding tears. Your mother
looked into the future. She begged me to go
when the time came, even though I must
leave her here."</p>

<p>"My lad,"&mdash;John Conrad laid his arm
across the boy's shoulders,&mdash;"there are many
things I would say to you. You were, as you
know, her darling. But she knew your faults,
that you are strong-headed and strong-willed.
As you are of all my children the quickest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
learn, so are you the least obedient and steady,
the most impatient and impetuous. Your
mother prayed for you daily. Will you remember
her counsels, lad?"</p>

<p>To the yearning voice Conrad could make
no answer. Arm in arm father and son stood
for a long time. Then, when the moon had
sunk behind the little church, Conrad felt
himself led away.</p>

<p>"Now, my son," admonished John Conrad,
"weep no more, but set your face forward."</p>

DOWN THE RIVER</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> night of the twenty-third of June is
a short night at best. When one robs its
beginning of four or five hours, there is little
darkness left. Bidding his son go to bed, John
Conrad spent the night in vigil. In spite of
his reminder that this was not a time for grief,
he went again to the little church. From
thence he climbed through the ruined vineyards
to the pastures on the hill where his
father and his grandfather had pastured their
sheep and cattle. There he stood long and
looked about him, his mind traveling back to
the happiness of their peaceful lives, spent
in sturdy labor and sweetened by the honor
which they had had among their fellows.
Here were the roots of his own life, deep in the
soil&mdash;would God that he could stay where he
had been born! He was no longer young, responsibility
and adversity had made him old.
Those rosy stories of the new land&mdash;might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
they not be as other travelers' tales, concealing
a reality worse than this fearful present of
hunger and fear? Five hundred miles of river,
three thousand miles of sea, and then an unsettled
country! The same shapes of fear
which had fascinated and disturbed young
Conrad seemed now to await his father behind
every tree and bush.</p>

<p>Suddenly John Conrad heard a soft sound
on the summer wind. George Reimer, as restless
as himself, was somewhere about with his
dear flute. John Conrad bent his ear to the
direction from which the sound came. It was
a German hymn, "A Mighty Stronghold is
Our God." John Conrad lifted his head and
with it his heart. George Reimer would be
with them and George Reimer's flute. Returning
to his house, John Conrad lay down
for a little sleep before dawn.</p>

<p>But George Reimer did not go to the new
country. Upon the indescribable confusion of
the Weiser house the next morning, he came
smiling.</p>

<p>Into sheets and coverlets the Weisers had
tied all their movable possessions, the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
articles making curious knobs and projections
on the great bundles. The family spinning-wheel
must go&mdash;surely no article was more
necessary! This Conrad was to carry on his
back. The few cooking-pots which remained&mdash;these
must be taken, though all else were
left behind. Wardrobes were small, sheets
were few, pillows did not exist. The feather
beds could not be carried&mdash;these were given
to the neighbors.</p>

<p>About hovered all Gross Anspach. Each
person had brought a little gift, a tiny trinket
saved from the pillaging of the hamlet, a little
bouquet of the few garden flowers which had
survived the cruel winter, a loaf of bread or
a package of dried beans for soup. Catrina, a
baby on each arm, wept loudly. Each baby
had to be embraced many times by its departing
relatives and each departing relative had
to be embraced by all the village. Under foot,
six tiny kittens risked their lives. Old Redebach,
tottering feebly about, quoted warning
passages of Scripture:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is
a man that wandereth from his place.</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>On the doorstep sat Wolf, his solemn eyes
watching the scene in amazement. Everywhere
was confusion, everywhere was noise.</p>

<p>For a few moments George Reimer watched
quietly.</p>

<p>"Neighbors!" cried he. "If you cannot
help these friends, stand back! Here, Conrad,
I will tie that bundle. Here, John Frederick, I
am to be your horse as far as the river; see
that you behave, or I will run away. Sabina,
I will keep your kittens if I have to catch the
mice for them myself."</p>

<p>With one accord the Weisers turned upon
him.</p>

<p>"You are going with us, surely!"</p>

<p>"Only to the river." His eyes sought those
of John Conrad. "I cannot go farther. My
little sisters are too young, my father too
feeble, my mother is sick&mdash;I can neither take
them nor leave them alone."</p>

<p>"God will reward you," said John Conrad.
"But it is a sore loss to us."</p>

<p>In the end no one went beyond the river.
From weeping Gross Anspach the Weisers
and a dozen accompanying friends separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
themselves at seven o'clock, the Weisers carrying
nothing, the burdens on the shoulders
of their neighbors. At the heels of the procession
walked Wolf. At the summit of the first
hill all looked back, save Conrad. The little
village lay smiling in the sun; to the pilgrims
it seemed like Heaven.</p>

<p>"I cannot go," cried Magdalena.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, let us stay," begged Margareta.</p>

<p>Before John Conrad could answer, a cheerful
sound restored the courage of the pilgrims
and George Reimer's gay "Susy, dear Susy"
set their feet moving.</p>

<p>At the village of Oberdorf there was a halt,
while greetings were exchanged, explanations
made, and messages written down for friends
already in America. Among those to whom
greetings were sent was the magistrate who
must be by this time safely across the sea.</p>

<p>Here the Gross Anspachers, except the
schoolmaster, turned back and the Weisers
shouldered their own bundles. It became clear
now that there were more bundles than persons
and the fact occasioned much laughter
and readjustment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>At night the Weisers slept by the wayside.
The fare on the boat would draw a large sum
from John Conrad's store and not a penny
could be spent for lodging. Lulled by Reimer's
flute, they slept comfortably, and, roused by
the same music, were off soon after daylight.</p>

<p>At the river came the most difficult of partings.
Here George Reimer played a last
lullaby and a final reveillé. A river boat,
the Elspeth, had anchored near by for the
night and upon it the family took passage.
The goods were carried aboard and piled in
the center of the deck and John Conrad and
his eight children followed. At once came a
protest from the captain. Old Wolf could not
go, and Conrad was commanded to lead him
from the boat. Conrad forgot that he was
thirteen years old, forgot that he was the man
of the family next to his father, forgot his
boasted superiority to Margareta and Magdalena
and the rest, and threw his arms round
the old dog's neck.</p>

<p>"I cannot leave you! I cannot leave you!"</p>

<p>Then he felt himself lifted up and put
aboard the gangplank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, Conrad, there! I will take care of
him. I have given your father something for
you. Show yourself brave, dear lad!"</p>

<p>Stumbling, Conrad boarded the boat. He
saw the schoolmaster wave his hand, he saw
the green shores slip away, he heard his
father's voice.</p>

<p>"Your teacher gave me this for you,
Conrad."</p>

<p>"Oh, father!" cried Conrad.</p>

<p>In his hand lay the schoolmaster's flute.</p>

<p>"He said you were to practice diligently
and to remember him."</p>

<p>The message made Conrad weep the more.
He threw himself down on the pile of household
goods and hid his face.</p>

<p>When he looked up his father sat beside
him. In his hand were two books. He looked
at his son anxiously.</p>

<p>"Conrad, we are going among strange
people. The first are the Hollanders, with
whom we can make ourselves understood.
But of English we know nothing. Now we
will learn as well as we can, I and you. The
schoolmaster gave me an English Bible, in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
we will study daily, comparing it with our
own."</p>

<p>"What will we do about the language of
the savages?" asked Conrad, drying his tears.
"How will we make ourselves understood by
them?"</p>

<p>"There will be time enough for that. It is
probable that they compel them to learn
English. The savages are a long way off."</p>

<p>For a few days John Conrad and his son
studied diligently. There was little else to do
in the long hours which glided as quietly by
as the stream. The country about them was
unbroken and flat; here there went on a
simple life like their own. Everywhere were
to be seen in the brown fields and the dead
vineyards the ravages of the fearful winter.</p>

<p>In return for a little help about the boat,
the helmsman, who had served on English
ships, did his best to interpret the hardest
words for the students. To the surly captain
they dared not speak. Once the price for the
journey was paid into his hand, he seemed to
resent even the sight of his passengers. Frequently
he was not sober, and then the helms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>man
helped the Weisers to keep out of his
way. Unlike the rest of his race, he could
not endure the sound of music and Conrad
and his flute were objects of special dislike.
More than once he threatened to throw both
into the river.</p>

<p>When the boat stopped at the city of
Speyer for a day and night, studying and
flute-practicing stopped entirely and, urged
by the friendly helmsman, the Weisers went
on shore. Now for the first time the children
saw a large town; with eager expectation
they stepped on the wharf. But here, too,
was ruin and desolation. The great buildings,
burned by the enemy who had devastated
their own village, had not been restored;
the cathedral which towered above the ruins
was itself but a hollow shell. When they
reached the next large town of Mannheim,
they did not leave the boat. With increasing
longing they looked forward across the ocean
to the Paradise where the enemy had not
been.</p>

<p>Daily they were joined by other pilgrims
who like themselves looked forward with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
aching eyes to the distant country. The newcomers
had each his own story of persecution
and famine, of cold and misery. With them
John Conrad talked, gathering from them all
the information which they had about the
new country, comforting them as best he
could, and reading to them from Conrad's
little book. To the directions they listened
earnestly, hearing over and over again that
they must be patient, quick to hear and slow
to speak, that they must be diligent and
thrifty. About the dangers of the sea they
talked a great deal and were relieved to hear
that a journey on an inland river was valuable
as preparation for a journey on the ocean.
The little book advised also that those who
were about to take a journey by sea should
practice on a swing.</p>

<p>Each day the captain was less and less able
to navigate the ship. Finally the helmsman
took command, and while the captain lay
in a stupor, Conrad continued the forbidden
flute-playing. Growing careless, he was
caught, and the captain, who could reach
neither Conrad nor the flute, kicked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
family spinning-wheel into the river. The
loss was serious and it taught a bitter lesson.</p>

<p>It was the twenty-fourth of June when the
travelers left Gross Anspach; a month later
they were still far from the mouth of the
river. Each day passengers clamored on the
banks, each day the number of ships in the
river increased, slow packet boats which did
not go above Cologne or Mainz, and faster
boats which passed the heavily laden Elspeth
like birds. The river left the broad meadows
for a narrow gorge with precipitous banks
upon which stood imposing castles. At sight
of the castles the children were overcome with
awe.</p>

<p>"There is Bingen, and its mouse tower,
children," said John Conrad.</p>

<p>"Not where the bishop was eaten!" cried
Sabina.</p>

<p>"Yes; and about here the treasure of the
Niebelungen is buried."</p>

<p>"If we could only find it!" sighed Conrad.</p>

<p>"And there"&mdash;the helmsman pointed to
ruined walls upon the cliff side&mdash;"there a
brave trumpeter defended his master's life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
While his master and others escaped, he blew
bravely upon the walls to frighten the enemy,
and when they entered, there was no one left
to kill but him."</p>

<p>The watching of Barbara and John Frederick
in their trotting about the crowded ship
grew to be more and more of a task. The
first person who was pushed overboard was
made much of, and the man who rescued him
was considered a hero. When many had
fallen overboard and had been rescued the
passengers scarcely turned their heads.</p>

<p>As day after day passed and August drew
near its close, John Conrad became more and
more anxious.</p>

<p>"It is time we were sailing from England,"
said he uneasily to Conrad. "The journey
has taken long, food has been higher than I
thought, and we have had to pay tariff a
dozen times."</p>

<p>Again and again he took from his pocket
the letter of the magistrate of Oberdorf. Of
the chief of his fears he said nothing to Conrad.
The good Queen of England had offered
transportation to the distressed Germans;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
but had she realized, had any one anticipated
that so vast a throng would take her at her
word? The river captains told of weeks and
weeks of such crowding of the lower river.
Would there be ships enough to carry them
all to the New World? Would the Queen
provide for them until they could sail?</p>

<p>Presently rumors of trouble increased John
Conrad's fears. A passing boat declared that
the Germans were forbidden to enter Rotterdam,
the lowland city at which they would
have to take ship for England. The congestion
had become serious. The citizens of
Rotterdam announced that their patience
and their resources were exhausted; the Germans
could no longer wait there for English
boats; they must return whence they had
come.</p>

<p>At this announcement there was a loud
outcry. Like the Weisers, the other pilgrims
had sold or had given away everything except
the property they carried with them; if they
returned now, it would be to greater misery
than that which they had left. Go on they
must. John Conrad reminded them of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Lord in whom they trusted. The Queen had
promised and England was rich in resources.
The Queen's charity was not entirely disinterested;
she expected the Germans to people
her new colonies. Nor did John Conrad
believe that the Hollanders would see them
starve on the way to England. But even as
he argued with himself, his heart misgave
him. He had seen persons starve, he had seen
men and women and children struck down
by the swords of brutal soldiers. There was
nothing in the world, he believed, too terrible
for heartless men to do.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer to Rotterdam, the
anxiety of the helmsman was plain to be
seen.</p>

<p>"I pay no attention to what passers-by
say," he told John Conrad. "But if you see
any long, narrow boats, with the flag of Holland
flying, then it will be time to be frightened.
They will have the power to make us
turn back."</p>

<p>Each hour the rate of travel became slower
and slower. There was now no current whatever,
and for many days the wind did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
blow. Finally, when, at nightfall, the Elspeth
came into the harbor, John Conrad
breathed a deep sigh of relief. In the morning
the travelers saw next them at the wharf one
of the long boats which the helmsman had
described, and heard that it was to start in an
hour to warn all the pilgrims to return to
their homes.</p>

<p>The passengers of the Elspeth were not
allowed to enter the city, but were bidden to
wait on the wharf for English ships. Here
their quarters were almost as restricted as
they had been on shipboard. In prompt contradiction
of the statement that their patience
and their supplies were exhausted, the kind
Hollanders brought food to the guests who
had thrust themselves upon them.</p>

<p>Now the helmsman came to bid his friends
good-bye. John Conrad gave him many
blessings and the children cried bitterly and
embraced him.</p>

<p>"If he were only going with us, what fine
times we should have on the sea!" said Conrad.</p>

<p>"He seems like our last friend," mourned
Margareta. "Everything before us is strange."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"We thought George Reimer was our last
friend," said John Conrad. "Perhaps we
shall find other friends as good."</p>

<p>For four days, the Germans watched for a
ship. When at last two English vessels came
into the harbor and they were taken aboard,
the Weisers had little food and less money.
When John Conrad heard that no passage
was to be charged, he breathed another sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>"The good Queen will keep her promises,"
said he to his children. "The worst of our
troubles are over."</p>

<p>But within an hour it seemed that the worst
of their troubles had only begun. The channel
crossing was rough. From their fellow
travelers there was rising already a cry, which
was to grow louder and louder as the weeks
and months went by&mdash;"Would that we had
suffered those miseries which we knew rather
than tempt those which we did not know!"</p>

<p>When the ship entered the smooth waters
of the Thames River, the Germans began to
smile once more. About them were green
fields. They saw pleasant villages and broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
stretches of cultivated land and deer browsing
under mighty trees.</p>

<p>"If we might only stay here!" they sighed.</p>

<p>John Conrad shook his head.</p>

<p>"Here we should not find rest."</p>

<p>Once more the Germans disembarked, wondering
whether their stay on shore would be
long enough for a closer view of the fine
churches and palaces of London. Of so large
a city as this even John Conrad had never
dreamed.</p>

<p>"Shall we see the Queen?" asked Sabina in
a whisper of her father.</p>

<p>John Conrad smiled.</p>

<p>"We might see her riding in her chariot."</p>

<p>Then John Conrad grew sober. As they
stood crowded together upon the quay some
young lads shouted at them roughly. The ears
which expected only kindness were shocked.</p>

<p>"They say we are taking the bread from
their mouths," repeated Conrad. "They call
us 'rascally' Germans."</p>

<p>"There are rude folk everywhere," said
John Conrad.</p>

<p>He directed the children to take their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
bundles and follow a man who seemed to have
authority to conduct them to some place in
which they were to spend the night.</p>

<p>The way thither proved to be long. Again
and again it was necessary to stop to rest or
to give time for the short legs of the little
children to catch up. Again and again the
heavy burdens were shifted about. They
traveled into the open country&mdash;a strange
stopping place for those who were so soon to
continue their journey! They passed many
men and women who looked at them curiously.
Presently they heard their own German
speech.</p>

<p>"We will have to wait awhile, probably,
for ships," said John Conrad to his son. "Of
course we could not expect to go on at once.
We&mdash;"</p>

<p>John Conrad stopped short and let his
bundle slip to the ground. They had come
out upon a great space, which a few months
before had been an open heath. Now, as far
as the eye could reach, stretched long lines of
tents. It was no temporary lodging, for here
and there small frame store buildings had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
been erected and there were long-used, dusty
paths between the tents. Men and women
and children were going about, meals were
being prepared, there was everywhere the
sound of voices. John Conrad stood still in
amazement.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked.</p>

<p>A single sharp voice answered from the
doorway of a sutler's shop.</p>

<p>"We are Germans, lured hither by promise
of passage to America. Here we wait. Here
we have waited for months. Have you come,
oh, fool, to wait also?"</p>

<p>It was not the rudeness of the answer which
startled John Conrad, nor the discouraging
news which it announced, but the voice of the
speaker. For the speaker was none other than
his friend the magistrate of Oberdorf, supposed
to be by now upon the high seas or in
the new country.</p>

BLACKHEATH</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long moment Heinrich Albrecht,
the magistrate of Oberdorf, and John
Conrad Weiser, his friend, looked at each
other. John Conrad was the first to speak,
in a voice trembling with amazement and
alarm.</p>

<p>"Have you returned, Heinrich?"</p>

<p>The magistrate burst into a loud laugh.
He was a tall, thin man, of a type to whom
inaction is misery.</p>

<p>"I have not been away. Here"&mdash;he
waved his hand with a wide motion over
Blackheath&mdash;"here we lie, idle pensioners.
Here we have been since May, ever encouraged,
ever deluded. Here idleness and evil
customs are corrupting our youth. Here we
are dying."</p>

<p>Now the full meaning of the crowded
Rhine and the warning of the Hollanders
burst upon John Conrad. He looked at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
children, at the young girls, at the little boys,
and finally at plump, smiling John Frederick.
He thrust his hand into his almost empty
pocket, thinking of the long journey back to
Gross Anspach for which he had no money.
He thought of his high hopes of liberty and
peace and independence. He covered his face
with his hands so that his children might not
see his tears.</p>

<p>"I am here, father!" cried Conrad. "I am
strong! I can work!"</p>

<p>"They feed us," conceded the magistrate
of Oberdorf. "And they have given us some
clothing and these tents. But cold weather
will come and we shall die."</p>

<p>"Cold weather! We should be in the new
country by cold weather! You yourself
wrote that you were about to sail, that you
would sail on the next day. There!" John
Conrad drew from his bosom the tattered
letter. "I have stayed my soul upon it! I
have set out on this journey upon faith in
it!"</p>

<p>"I thought we should start. I was certain
we should start. They say there are no ships.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
They have begun to send some of us to Ireland."</p>

<p>John Conrad shook his head.</p>

<p>"This whole land is sick. Across the ocean
only there is peace."</p>

<p>"I can get a tent for you beside mine,"
offered Albrecht. "I have a little influence
with those in authority."</p>

<p>Once more the Weisers shouldered their
bundles. They crossed the wide camp,
greeted pleasantly here and there, but for the
most part stared at silently and contemptuously.
Finally the magistrate acknowledged
grudgingly that the English people had been
liberal and kind.</p>

<p>"But they are growing tired. The common
people say we are taking the bread from
their mouths."</p>

<p>The farther the Weisers proceeded through
the city of tents, the more astonished they
became.</p>

<p>"The poor Germans have washed like the
waves of the sea upon these shores," said
Albrecht.</p>

<p>John Conrad shook his head in answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
having no more words with which to express
his astonishment.</p>

<p>The Weisers made themselves as comfortable
as possible in the tent assigned them.
They unpacked the bundles which they had
expected to unpack only in the new country,
they received a portion of the generous supply
of food which was given out each morning
and evening, and then, like the thousands
of their fellow countrymen, they waited, now
hopefully, now almost in despair, for some
change in their condition.</p>

<p>But no sign of change appeared. Day after
day John Conrad and the magistrate and the
friends whom they made among the more
intelligent and thoughtful of the pilgrims met
and talked and looked toward the Blackheath
Road for some messenger from the
Queen. The young people made acquaintance;
the children played games and ran races
up and down the streets of the city of tents.
Sometimes Conrad listened to his elders and
sometimes he played his flute for the children.</p>

<p>Suddenly the weather changed. The outdoor
life which had been pleasant became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
more and more difficult to bear. The nights
grew cold; the Germans shivered in their poor
clothes. Now, also, another and a more serious
danger threatened them.</p>

<p>The cooking was done over open fires, and
the Weisers went daily into a forest a few
miles away to gather sticks for their contribution
to the one nearest to them. One day a
young Englishman, with an evil face, spoke
roughly to Margareta, who cowered back.
He went nearer to her and she screamed
in terror. For an instant Conrad watched
stupidly, then, suddenly, his heart seemed
to expand. He was, as his father had said,
strong-headed and strong-willed.</p>

<p>"Let her be!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The stranger laughed, and approached
nearer still. They could not understand what
he said, nor did he have opportunity to continue
what he had begun to say. Before his
hand touched the arm of Margareta, he found
himself upon the ground. Conrad was not
tall, but he had strong muscles; now from his
safe position on the chest of the enemy he
was able to dictate terms of peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"You get up and run as fast as you can
down the road," he shouted. "George Frederick,
give me that big stick."</p>

<p>Fortunately the Englishman had no friends
at hand. He looked about wildly, first at
the Weisers, then toward the camp, and
promptly did as he was bid. As he went, he
shouted a threat.</p>

<p>"Your whole camp is to be wiped out," he
yelled from a safe distance. "Wait and you
will see!"</p>

<p>The hearts of the Germans, growing daily
more alarmed, were no more disturbed,
meanwhile, than were the hearts of Queen
Anne and her ministers. While the unexpected
thousands lay upon Blackheath, minister
consulted with minister, boards of trade
met to discuss plans and to give them up,
and to discuss other plans and to adjourn
and to meet again. It was true that Queen
Anne desired to settle her colony of New
York, true that the news of her desire had
been spread abroad. But she had not anticipated
this great migration, like the locusts of
Egypt for numbers! Ships were lacking to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
transport them; suitable asylums were lacking
and the Germans themselves, fleeing like
helpless children, were not able to take care
of themselves.</p>

<p>Scores of wise and foolish suggestions were
offered. The Germans were to be sent to distant
parishes, together with a bounty for
each one. But the parishes did not welcome
them; those who were sent returned, poorer,
weaker, more helpless than before. There
were hundreds of good workmen among them,
but even the English workman could scarcely
earn his bread. Let them go to Ireland, let
them go to Wales, let them return to Germany.</p>

<p>And still, while the English talked, the
Germans came. Finally, Her Majesty's
Council, meeting almost daily, reached a
conclusion and orders were given for the
assembling of ships. Action was hastened by
an extraordinary incident in which Conrad
and his father had a part.</p>

<p>The heavy frosts had begun and there was
not an hour when the Germans did not ache
with the cold. The quantity of food had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
become smaller, the quality poorer than at
first. But worse than cold or hunger was the
danger from the rising resentment of the
Londoners, who demanded that this great
mass of foreigners be removed.</p>

<p>Conrad, left to himself, with little to do,
roamed about the city, staring at its marvels,
at strange London Bridge, crowded
with shops and houses which hung over the
water, at mighty Saint Paul's Cathedral, lifting
its round dome, still beautifully white
and clean, far above the gabled city roofs, at
the other new churches built since the great
fire, and at the soaring monument which
commemorated the fire. He even looked with
awe and horror at the sad and terrible spot
where had been buried, in a deep pit, the
victims of the great plague.</p>

<p>Conrad's journeys were not always comfortable.
English lads taunted him, gayly
dressed young men ordered him out of their
path, the bearers of sedan chairs thrust him
rudely against the house walls. But still he
walked about, watching and listening.</p>

<p>Presently he heard terrifying threats. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Londoners determined to wait no longer to
wreak their vengeance upon Blackheath.
Conrad hurried down the long road to make
report to his father.</p>

<p>"They mean to attack us with knives,
father. They declare they will have no
mercy upon us!"</p>

<p>"They would not dare," answered John
Conrad. "We are under the protection of the
Queen."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, John Conrad called together
his friends, and together they drew up a humble
petition, praying that the English people
continue to look kindly upon them and to
bestow bounty upon them.</p>

<p>But the petition availed nothing. That
very night, Conrad, lying in his corner of
the tent near the edge of the camp, heard
the sound of rough voices and heavy steps.
Springing up, he looked out the door. On the
heath a large company had gathered, carrying
knives and sickles which gleamed in the
moonlight. With a shout Conrad roused his
family, whose cries in turn roused the sleepers
in the neighboring tents. The attacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
party was defeated, not so much by the resistance
of the Germans, few of whom had
arms, as by a warning that the soldiers were
coming from London. The Germans were
not seriously hurt, but the event was ominous.</p>

<p>Still the days grew shorter, and the dark
nights longer, and the air colder. Hundreds
gathered round the fires, and among them
John Conrad counseled further patience and
continued courage. Frequently he read to
them from Conrad's little book, at whose
directions for life on the ocean and in the new
land there were now bitter smiles and long
sighs. They had ceased to think of the new
country with its rich soil, its mild climate, and
its strange, interesting aborigines, except to
envy the Indian his indifference to the comforts
of civilization.</p>

<p>Upon the day of the first snow, Conrad
went early into the city. He had earned a
penny a few days before by carrying some
bales from a ship to a warehouse, and he
hoped to earn more.</p>

<p>Until noon he walked about the streets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Again and again he was cursed and threatened.
The Londoners had not finished with
the Germans in spite of their temporary defeat.
At noon he ate the piece of black bread
which he had put into his pocket, and then
went into a cold church to rest. Presently he
fell asleep, and when he woke late in the afternoon
the church was almost dark. He was
miles away from Blackheath and he must
set out promptly or the dangers of the way
would be doubled. The week before he had
been caught in a fog and had spent the night
inside a garden gate on the ground.</p>

<p>Leaving the church, he hurried on as fast
as he could. It seemed to him that another
fog was rapidly gathering over the city. His
long walks and the insufficient food had made
him weak, but it was better to start on the
homeward journey than to linger. He might
fall into evil hands and never see his father or
brothers or sisters again. The words of old
Redebach in far-away Gross Anspach came
back to him as he stepped out from the church
door into an open square,&mdash;"<i>As a bird that
wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>dereth
from his place.</i>" Perhaps old Redebach
was right!</p>

<p>In the square, sedan chairs moved about,
link boys waved their torches and shouted,
rough men jostled him. Presently his tears
gathered and began to fall. He lowered his
head and plodded on down the street, little
dreaming that before him waited one of the
strangest encounters, not only in his life, but
in the strange history of the world.</p>

<p>Too tired and despairing to remember that
traveling with bent head is unsafe, struggling
to keep back his tears, he ceased suddenly to
feel anything. He came full force against one
of the new lamp-posts recently set up, and
was thrown backwards.</p>

<p>When he came to himself, he heard but one
sound, that of cruel laughter. The amusement
of the onlookers was the last drop in
poor Conrad's cup of grief. As he staggered
to his feet, he said to himself that he wished
that the lamp-post had brought him to that
death which was approaching for him and his
fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>When the dizziness following his fall had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
passed and he was ready to start on once
more, he observed that the steps of the passers-by
were unusually hurried and that all
led in the same direction. He looked back to
see the object toward which they were hastening.
At the sight which met his eyes he
gave a startled cry. He was dreaming or he
had gone mad.</p>

<p>This was England and London, this was
the heart of the largest city in the world.
America, the longed-for, with its great forests
and its mighty hunters, lay far across the sea
three thousand miles away. But through the
London fog, surrounded by a great crowd
above whom they towered, there came toward
Conrad four giant creatures, with bronze-colored
skins, with deer-hide shoes, with
headdresses of waving feathers, and with
scarlet blankets. Conrad rubbed his eyes; he
looked again. They came nearer and nearer,
they seemed more and more majestic and
terrible.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, they vanished, as though
the earth had swallowed them. They could
not have entered a house since there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
dwelling-houses here, and the shops were
closed. Risking a rebuff as cruel as that from
the lamp-post, Conrad grasped the arm of the
man nearest him and poured out a dozen
excited questions.</p>

<p>"These are Indians from the wilds of
America," answered the stranger.</p>

<p>"Why are they here? What does it mean?
Could I speak to them? Where did they go?"</p>

<p>The stranger's patience was soon exhausted.
After he had explained that the
savages had gone into the theater, he left
Conrad to address his questions to the empty
air.</p>

<p>For a moment Conrad stared at the spot
from which the Indians had vanished. If he
only had money to pay his way into the theater
also! But he was penniless. The next
best thing was to tell his father, as soon as
possible, of this incredible experience. Running
heavily, he crossed London Bridge and
started out upon the Blackheath Road, saying
over and over to himself, "The Indians
are here! The Indians are here!"</p>

<p>So tired was he and so much confused by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the strange sight which he had seen that it
was many hours before he reached his father's
tent. He imagined that the long journey had
been made and that he was already in the
forests of the new country. At last an acquaintance,
meeting him at the edge of the
camp, led him to John Conrad.</p>

<p>"Here is your boy. He was about to walk
straight into a fire."</p>

<p>Fed and warmed, Conrad could only repeat
over and over the magic words, "The Indians
are here!" His father thought he was delirious;
the children cried. For a long time after
he had fallen into the heavy sleep of exhaustion,
his sisters watched him.</p>

<p>At dawn, when he woke, he found himself
stiff and sore and inexpressibly tired. But his
head was clear, and slowly the events of the
day before came back to him. The Indians
were real; to-day he would find them. If they
had come from America there would be a way
to return. He would beg them on his knees to
take him and his family with them. Perhaps
they had come in their own ships.</p>

<p>Slipping from between his sleeping brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
he lifted the flap of the tent and stepped
out into the cold morning air. He could not
wait for the family to rise; he would take his
share of black bread and be gone.</p>

<p>Then, again, Conrad cried out. Last night
he had beheld the strangers through the
medium of a thickening mist and with eyes
confused by his fall. Now he saw them clearly
in the bright morning light, here upon Blackheath
before his father's tent! The eagle
feathers waved above their heads; their scarlet
mantles wrapped them round; they stole
quietly about on moccasined feet.</p>

<p>For a long moment the Indians looked at
Conrad and Conrad looked back at them. It
was as though they measured one another
through an eternity, the tall savages from
across three thousand miles of sea and the
little lad from Gross Anspach. The lad's
heart throbbed with awe and wonder. What
the savages thought it was difficult to say.
They made to one another strange guttural
sounds which evidently served for speech. It
seemed to Conrad that they were about to
turn away. It was as though a heavenly visi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>tor
had descended only to depart. Conrad
ran forward and grasped the hand of one of
the mighty creatures.</p>

<p>"Oh, take us with you, father and Margareta
and Magdalena and the others and
me! Take us with you! We will work and we
will learn to hunt. There is no home for us
here. We suffer and die. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a commotion at the tent door
and Conrad looked round. In the doorway
stood John Conrad, blinking, incredulous.</p>

<p>"I saw them last night, father. I have
asked them to take us with them." Conrad
began to make gestures. "Us, with you, far
away to the west!" It was a request easy to
make clear.</p>

<p>Again the savages uttered their strange
guttural speech. They, in turn, made motions
to John Conrad and his son, that they should
come with them. Not for an instant did John
Conrad hesitate. Upon this miraculous encounter
important things might depend.</p>

<p>"Conrad," he began, "while I am gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, father, take me with you! I beg, take
me with you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Run and find Albrecht then, my son, and
ask him to look after the children."</p>

<p>Conrad was gone like the wind. Now the
Weiser children and the neighbors were staring
with terrified eyes at the red men. They
gave a little scream when John Frederick toddled
forward and fell over the foot of one of
the Indians and then held their breaths while
he was lifted high in the strong arms. John
Conrad offered some of his small supply of
black bread and his strange guests grunted
their pleased acceptance. Then John Conrad
and his son set out with the Indians to make
the rounds of the camp.</p>

<p>What the savages thought of the assemblage
of misery it was hard to say. They
walked briskly so that the two Weisers could
scarcely keep up with them; they pointed
now to a sick child, now to some adult who
showed more clearly than the others the effects
of cold and anxiety and hunger. Often
they motioned toward the west, a gesture
which it seemed to Conrad had a heavenly
significance.</p>

<p>When the circuit of the camp was com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>plete,
they made it plain to the Weisers that
they expected them to follow to the city, and
father and son, looking their vague hopes into
one another's eyes, obeyed eagerly.</p>

<p>Along the Blackheath Road they went,
through Southwark and across London
Bridge&mdash;how many times had Conrad traveled
the road in despair! Presently, when,
after they had crossed the Thames and were
in the city, a man would have jostled Conrad
from his place beside the leader, the Indian
cried out fiercely, and the stranger dropped
quickly back into the long queue of men and
boys who had gathered. Now the Indians motioned
to Conrad that he should walk behind
the leader and his father behind him. Thus
strangely escorted, the two Germans went
through the streets. Conrad saw in the eyes
of the boys whom they passed a look of envy.
The course of fate had changed!</p>

<p>A few times John Conrad spoke to his son.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Not I."</p>

<p>"Pray God that this strange way may lead
to the new land."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will, father."</p>

<p>With heads erect the chiefs went on as
though they trod the leafy paths of their own
forests. Presently they came out upon the
river-bank once more, traveled upon it for a
short distance, then turned aside. The crowd
about them had changed its character. Here
were fine gentlemen and ladies on foot and in
richly decked sedan chairs. A gentleman came
forward with a sharp exclamation and pointed
questioningly at the Weisers. One of the
Indians answered by gestures and a few incomprehensible
words, and the gentleman
looked as though he were considering some
strange thing. When the Indians walked on
without waiting for his answer, Conrad began
to be frightened.</p>

<p>"Where will they take us, father?"</p>

<p>John Conrad's voice trembled.</p>

<p>"They are taking us into the Queen's palace,"
said he.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a><br />

A ROYAL AUDIENCE</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">At</span> the door of St. James's Palace all but
a few of the throng which followed the
Indian chiefs and the Weisers were denied
entrance. The finely dressed gentleman who
had spoken to the Indians, and who evidently
knew their own language, was allowed to pass
under the stone archway and into the court
and thence into the palace itself. The Indians
still led the way, traveling quietly along
through intricate passages and tapestry-hung
halls. Courtiers passed them with curious
stares.</p>

<p>Still they kept the two Weisers behind the
leader. Presently they halted in a room where
there was a fire blazing on the hearth and
where fine ladies laughed and talked. On the
opposite side from the entrance a thick curtain
hung over a doorway. The leading chief
walked directly toward it and there paused,
the procession behind him coming to a stop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
A little lady sitting by the fire accepted a
challenge from her companions to salute the
strangers, and came across the floor, her high
heels tapping as she walked.</p>

<p>"O great King of Rivers," said she to the
foremost Indian, "who are these your companions?"</p>

<p>The Indian's answer was interpreted by the
gayly dressed gentleman who understood his
tongue.</p>

<p>"The King of Rivers says that these are his
friends."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Colonel Schuyler. Tell the
King of Rivers that his friends need a red
blanket like his own and&mdash;"</p>

<p>What else they needed Conrad and his
father were not to hear. The curtain before
them was lifted, and from the other side a
high, clear voice announced,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The chiefs of the Mohawk Nation!"</p>

<p>Moving as in a dream, their eyes dazzled
and their hearts confused, the two Weisers
went on. They found themselves now in a
still more magnificent room. At its far end
there was a group of gentlemen surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
a lady who sat in a throne-like chair. She
was grave of aspect and there was upon her
face the indelible impression of grief. On her
white hands and her neck were sparkling
jewels. The gentlemen about her were wigged
and powdered, and wore in their long sleeves
white lace ruffles which almost hid their
hands.</p>

<p>So astonished and confused was Conrad
that his father had to command him twice
to make obeisance.</p>

<p>"To your knees, boy! To your knees,
Conrad! It is the Queen!"</p>

<p>The Indians did not bend, but stood with
arms folded under their scarlet blankets, in
their dark, shining eyes a look of friendly regard
for the little lady who was a ruler like
themselves. The Queen looked at the two
Germans with curious but kindly astonishment.
Neither John Conrad nor his son was
in court array, though the needles of Margareta
and Magdalena kept them fairly neat
and whole.</p>

<p>"Good Peter," said Queen Anne, "who are
these?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger who had interpreted for the
Indians rose from his knees.</p>

<p>"They are Germans from the camp on
Blackheath, dear madam. Your friends of the
Mohawk Nation went early this morning to
visit that great settlement and have brought
with them from there these folk, father and
son, to their appointment with the Queen.
From this intention they could not be stayed,
but insist that they have a communication of
importance to make concerning these strangers."</p>

<p>The Queen looked smilingly at her Indian
friends and then at the two Germans.</p>

<p>"The condition of those helpless people is
on our minds. Let our friends of the Mohawk
Nation speak."</p>

<p>Surely the audience room had never heard
a stranger sound than that which now filled
it! The tallest of the chiefs responded, speaking
at length, with many sweeping gestures.
Conrad strained his ears&mdash;oh, how longingly!&mdash;but
could understand nothing. The
chief seemed to be speaking of some spot far
away and also of the two Germans. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
word Conrad heard, he was certain, again and
again, but he could not retain its strange
sound.</p>

<p>When the Indian had finished, Colonel
Schuyler began to translate his words, imitating
also his motions toward the west and his
pointing to the Weisers.</p>

<p>"Your friend the King of Rivers has this
to say, O Queen. He and his companions of
the Mohawk Nation have walked about to
see the city where so many hundreds of people
live in so small a space. Far to the south
they have visited also the settlement of misery
known as the German camp. The distress
of these people is terrible to them. It is a
dreadful thing to them that men should be so
crowded together when there is so much space
in the world, so much land for planting corn
and so many wide forests for hunting. The
King of Rivers recalls to you the object of his
long and perilous journey across the ocean
in an unsteady ship. He reminds you that
he seeks for himself and his allied nations
protection against the growing power of his
enemies, both Indian and French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now he would offer for these poor Germans
his country of Schoharie"&mdash;there was
the word which Conrad had heard again and
again!&mdash;"where there are fine streams for
fishing and much land for planting and hunting.
There, when there is no war, men and
women are happiest of all the places on the
earth. His people are faithful people, keeping
their word, and aiding and protecting
unto death those in whom they can trust. If
you will send these afflicted people to Schoharie,
then together the Indians and the Germans
can keep the peace with the western
Indians, and the French will not dare to attack
them."</p>

<p>The Indians nodded their heads solemnly
as Colonel Schuyler finished. They had entire
confidence in him and trusted him to
repeat their words exactly.</p>

<p>The Queen looked at the two humble figures
before her. Their blue eyes met hers
with a great longing.</p>

<p>"Speak!" said she.</p>

<p>John Conrad took a step forward. His English
was broken, but none the less eloquent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Madam, all they say of our misery is
true. We are indeed desolate and afflicted.
We have been harried by the sword; we have
perished by cold and starvation. Your enemies
the French are our enemies. At the
hands of our own princes we have perished
for conscience' sake. We are of your faith,
O Queen!&mdash;those of us that are left. The
good God in heaven does not send his creatures
into the world to be thus destroyed. We
seek not idleness and repose for our bodies,
but labor for our bodies and repose for our
souls. We long as the hart pants after water
brooks for this new country. You have
brought us thus far out of our wilderness;
send us now into this new land where there is
peace! We have nothing, nothing. We cannot
pay except by our labor in a new country.
We ask bounty as we ask the bounty of
Heaven, because we are helpless. You have
already marvelously befriended us. But for
you we should not be living at this day."</p>

<p>The Queen turned to the gentleman who
sat nearest to her.</p>

<p>"He speaks well, my lord."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"He speaks from the soul, Madam."</p>

<p>Now the Queen conversed rapidly and in a
low tone with Peter Schuyler&mdash;too rapidly
for the Weisers to understand. She mentioned
one Hunter of whom they knew nothing,
and they waited uneasily, afraid that
their audience was at an end and that nothing
had been accomplished. When the doorkeeper
came forward and led them away,
leaving their Indian friends behind, their
hearts sank. They made obeisance to the
Queen and went slowly toward the door, not
daring to speak. Then they saw that Colonel
Schuyler followed them.</p>

<p>"This day one week at this hour the Queen
will see you again. Can you find your way
thither?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, my lord!" answered John Conrad.</p>

<p>Outside the two met again curious glances,
heard again amused comment. But they regarded
neither, scarcely indeed saw the smiles
or heard the laughter. Hope had once more
taken up an abode in their weary hearts.</p>

<p>Daily in the week which followed, Conrad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
made his way from Blackheath to St. James's
Palace, where he gazed at the stone archway
and then wandered farther hoping to see
again the Indians. To the other Germans the
Weisers said nothing of their hopes. The Indians
had led them into the city and had
there held conversation with them through
an interpreter,&mdash;beyond that fact they did
not go. Their fellow countrymen had been
too often cruelly disappointed; until the
blessed possibilities of which the Weisers
dreamed had become certainties, they would
say nothing.</p>

<p>Yet hope in their own hearts rose higher
and higher. Once more Conrad read his little
book, finding in his new acquaintances proof
of all that was said in praise of the Indian
and contradiction of all that was said in his
disparagement. The word "Schoharie" he
wrote down and said over and over in his
waking hours and in his dreams at night.</p>

<p>He had formed a friendship with a lad of
his own age, Peter Zenger by name, who, with
his ailing father, had suffered as the Weisers
had suffered and who had a similar longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
for the new land. From Peter during this
week he held aloof, determined to tell his
secret to no one.</p>

<p>Conrad thought a great deal of his father
and of the attentive way in which the Queen
and her court had listened to him. His father
was poor and he had miserable clothes, yet he
had not trembled. Of all the Germans no one,
not even the magistrate of Oberdorf, who
was so certain of his own powers, could have
done so well.</p>

<p>On the morning of the appointment John
Conrad and his son waited for an hour outside
the palace gateway. The unkindly feeling
of the populace toward the Germans had
increased rather than diminished, and as they
walked up and down many persons spoke
roughly to them. But again, wrapped in
their own anxious thoughts, they heard with
indifference.</p>

<p>Again the Queen sat in the throne-like
chair with her gentlemen about her, the same
gentlemen so far as Conrad could see, except
one who now sat nearest to the Queen and to
whom she was speaking when they entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
They looked in vain for their friends of the
Mohawk Nation.</p>

<p>The Queen bade the Weisers sit side by
side on a cushioned bench before her while
she continued her conversation with the newcomer
whom she called Hunter. Then she
bade John Conrad tell again the story of his
misfortunes and she listened attentively, her
eyes fastened upon him.</p>

<p>John Conrad spoke eloquently, though
brokenly, once more, and omitted nothing.
When in the midst of his account of persecution
and misery, one of the fine gentlemen
would have stopped him, the Queen bade the
story go on.</p>

<p>"It is good for us to hear these things. And
your wife,&mdash;you say nothing of her."</p>

<p>Nor did John Conrad say anything. He
tried, stammered, halted, tried again, and
failed once more. In a second one of the
fine gentlemen, Lord Marlborough, began to
speak in his easy way. The Queen's face was
white, her lips twitched, and she smoothed
nervously the black stuff of which her dress
was made. Lord Marlborough talked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
and on until the Queen herself interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"We have heard this sad tale before, but
never so well told. It is our intention to do all
for these poor Germans that we can. In our
colony of New York we have already settled
the first of those who have come to us. There
they dwell in happiness along the banks of
Hudson's River and have made for themselves
comfortable villages. It is our intention to
establish others there in a similar way.</p>

<p>"In return we ask certain labors. Our enemies
are many. It is necessary that we maintain
for ourselves a large fleet upon the sea.
Tar and pitch we must buy in great quantities
from Sweden and Russia&mdash;an enormous
and unnecessary expense. In our colony of
New York, so says its Governor Hunter, are
thousands of acres of pine trees from which
we could distill, if we had the workmen, our
own supplies. Do you think the Germans
could make tar?"</p>

<p>"What others can do, we can do," answered
John Conrad. "We are not below the
rest of the world in intelligence, though we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
in possessions. We have among us men of
many crafts&mdash;husbandmen and vine-dressers,
masons and bakers and carpenters, herdsmen
and blacksmiths and tanners and millers
and weavers. Oh, dear lady, if we were but
there!"</p>

<p>"The grapes of the new land are said to be
finer than the grapes of France," said Lord
Marlborough. "It would not be amiss if we
could draw from our own stores."</p>

<p>Governor Hunter leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"It will be time to think of wine when Her
Majesty's ships are well caulked," said he
impatiently. "The trees must be properly
barked two years before they are cut and
burned. There will be no time for vine-dressing.
The project is as sure of success as the
rising of the sun. It cannot fail. Meanwhile,
there will be work in other crafts also as in
all new settlements. It is understood that
the Germans have here an opportunity to
repay some of the great expense to which we
have been put on their account."</p>

<p>"We would not have it otherwise," cried
John Conrad. "We are not beggars, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
as we beg for a chance to earn our bread.
Would that we might begin to-day to pay our
great debt!"</p>

<p>The Queen smiled.</p>

<p>"We must have ships, and they are not
easy to find in a sufficient number at present
to transport this host. But tell your friends
to hold themselves in readiness."</p>

<p>Now Conrad breathed a long sigh.</p>

<p>"The lad looks at me with a question in
his eyes," said the Queen. "What is it, boy?"</p>

<p>"Will our new home be near these kind
Indians?" asked Conrad, trembling.</p>

<p>"Governor Hunter, what of this?"</p>

<p>"There are Indians everywhere in plenty,"
said he.</p>

<p>Colonel Schuyler rose, and John Conrad,
feeling himself dismissed, rose also.</p>

<p>The Queen stopped them with a lifted
hand.</p>

<p>"About these same Indians, good Weiser.
Our possessions lie along the east coast of this
great and unexplored country. To the north
and to the west, along the course of a vast
river and the shores of large inland bodies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
water, the French have by guile got possession
of the land. Between live tribes of savages,
upon whose friendship depends enormous
issues. Give thought to this, you and
your friends. These Indians who are here
represent a great nation or confederation of
nations, skilled in the warfare of the forest.
It is important that they continue to be our
friends. I am told that they do not regard
lightly deceit of any sort, and that their revenge
upon the treacherous is hideous beyond
all describing. Now, fare you well."</p>

<p>Again John Conrad tried to speak his
gratitude, but could say no word. He dropped
to his knees once more, then rose and followed
Colonel Schuyler to the door. There Colonel
Schuyler put a gold piece into his hand.</p>

<p>"For you and Magdalena and Margareta
and John Frederick and the others," said he.
"The Queen's bounty."</p>

<p>By noon of the next day, the German settlement
was ready to take ship. John Conrad,
as he carried his remarkable announcement
from tent to tent and from fire to fire, gave
warning that sailing might still be delayed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
that the ships were not yet in the harbor,
that only a few hundreds could be carried on
each vessel, and that these hundreds would
be selected according to a method of which
they knew nothing.</p>

<p>But the Germans would not hear. They
packed their belongings once more into
bundles, and depression gave place to good
cheer, solemnity to hilarity. Some let the
fires before their tents go out and all spent
their small remaining sums of money for
provisions to take on shipboard.</p>

<p>Alas, bundles were unpacked, fires were
relighted, and the food purchased for the sea
eaten on land long before the ships were in
harbor and the Germans on board. Some of
the bundles were then packed once more by
other hands. Before the hour for sailing hundreds
of pilgrims, among them the disappointed
magistrate of Oberdorf, had come
to the end of their journey. The Blackheath
camp had become a camp of death.</p>

<p>In the weeks which now followed, John
Conrad was summoned twice to the palace,
not to see the Queen or to meet his Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
benefactors, but to have explained to him,
as the chief representative of the Germans,
their duties in the new world. Once more the
need of the English navy for tar was made
clear and the method for extracting it from
the pine trees carefully explained. Governor
Hunter, who talked to John Conrad at
length, was quick of speech and temper, a
man who brooked no opposition and listened
to few questions.</p>

<p>To John Conrad was presented a contract
for his signature and that of other Germans,
by which they were to promise to perform
that which the Queen required. With happy
hearts they promised; with overflowing gratitude
they heard that they were to receive,
after their debt to the Government was paid,
twenty-five dollars and forty acres of land.</p>

<p>Finally, as Christmas Day drew near, good
news came to Blackheath. Ships would be
provided for all, the first sailing on Christmas
Day. Assigned to the first ship were the
Weisers and Conrad's friend Peter Zenger
and his father. The rabble of London gathered
at the camp to see the Germans start,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
but now their taunts fell on deaf ears. The
new country was just across the sea; peace
and plenty were at hand. They thought with
sad regret of those who had started with
them, but who were no longer here to continue
the journey.</p>

<p>Though it was winter, the Germans thought
little of the storms which they would meet
at sea. They were landsmen who knew nothing
of the fierce power of the ocean. If they
remembered the roughness of the Channel
crossing, it was with the consoling reflection
that the ocean was there confined to narrow
bounds, like the Rhine where its rapids were
so swift. It was true that Conrad's little book
advised various precautions against illness
and misery. But they refused to think of illness
or misery. With their long journey so
nearly ended, they could endure both.</p>

<p>Conrad brought out from its hiding-place
George Reimer's flute and discovered to his
delight that Peter Zenger had a drum. Perhaps
there would be other instruments upon
the ship and a band could be formed.</p>

<p>To the eyes of Conrad and Peter the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Lyon looked enormous as it lay in the harbor,
its mighty sails furled. From its sides there
projected four cannon, regarded by the two
boys with terror and delight. A sailor standing
on the quay explained that they were to
deal with the French and with pirates.</p>

<p>"Pirates!" repeated Conrad. "What are
they?"</p>

<p>"They are freebooters," explained Peter.
"I have heard of them. They attack any one
whom they please and kill and rob."</p>

<p>"Are we <i>sure</i> to meet them?" asked Conrad.</p>

<p>"They come out from the shore like
wolves," answered the sailor. "But with
these cross dogs we can scare them off."</p>

<p>But whether there were pirates or not,
whether there were storms to meet, or
whether they were to sail in a continued calm,
the Germans must now get aboard. On Christmas
morning the first four hundred embarked
upon the ship Lyon for another stage of the
long journey.</p>

ACROSS THE SEA</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">So</span> welcome had been the sight of the ship,
so blessed the prospect of being able to
set out once more, that the Weisers and
their friends had no fault to find with the
meager provision which had been made for
them. They trooped joyfully aboard, disposing
themselves and their goods as well as
they could. It was true that what seemed to
be a large space shrank amazingly as the passengers
found places for the bundles and
boxes which remained in their possession in
spite of all their misfortunes, but of lack of
space they made light. Thus crowded together
they would not suffer so dreadfully
from the cold as they had in the open tents
of Blackheath. Besides, the journey would
soon be over. Those who had misgivings as
the shores of England dropped out of sight,
smiled to see Conrad and Peter gazing longingly
from the boat's prow toward the west.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>In comparison with the journey down the
Rhine the journey across the Atlantic is dull
to most travelers. There are no interesting
waitings at landings, there are no towering
castles, there are no flowery meadows. But
to the children on the ship Lyon there was
no moment without its entertainment. There
was, to begin with, the never-ending motion
of the sea; there was, for the first few days,
the almost hourly sight of a distant sail.
Presently they began to watch for the spouting
of whales and for the dipping and soaring
of creatures which were half bird, half fish.</p>

<p>The voyage began in a long and unusual
calm, so that the older folk could sit comfortably
on the deck in the sunshine and the children
could scamper about at their games.
The captain and the crew were kind and patient,
as they needed to be to answer the
numberless questions about the ship and her
rudder and her white sails and the wide sea
upon which she traveled. The mate had
crossed the Atlantic Ocean four times and
had been many times to Marseilles: to the
shivering girls and the delighted boys he told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
a hundred tales of storms, of waves covering
the ship, of rigging locked in ice, of flights
from pirates and of battles with the French.</p>

<p>"Shall we meet storms like that?" they
asked, terrified, yet eager.</p>

<p>"I've crossed when the sea was like a raging
lion," answered the mate, to please the
boys; "and when she was like a smooth pond,"
he added, to please the girls.</p>

<p>Presently the mate rigged up a fishing-line
with which the boys took turns. Peter Zenger
added an edible dolphin to the ship's food&mdash;that
was the first catch. Then, Conrad, feeling
a powerful tug at his line, was convinced that
he had caught a whale, and screamed for help.</p>

<p>"It will pull me over," he called. "Come
quickly!"</p>

<p>The sailor who came to his aid laughed.</p>

<p>"You could have let go!"</p>

<p>When they hauled in the catch it proved to
be a shark, at whose enormous mouth and
hideous teeth the girls screamed. Thereafter
they scarcely looked over the side of the ship.</p>

<p>Among themselves the older folk reviewed
again and again their persecutions, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
griefs, and their hopes. To the younger men
and women John Conrad talked long and
earnestly.</p>

<p>"If all that we hear is true, children, this
new land will be the finest land in the world.
There are fertile fields; there are great forests
and rivers, such as we know nothing of; there
are rich ores. Above all, there are young,
eager hearts. I believe that there will also be
new governments, which will, please God, be
different from the old. In this new country
every man should have a fair chance. I am
growing old, I shall not have much to do with
the affairs of the new country, but my children
may. Let them remember their own
history and be always on the side of the oppressed.
You may be divided from one another.
Our new friends may forsake us. You
will have griefs and sorrows like the rest of
mankind. You must learn to find companionship
in yourselves and help from above. You
must learn to be independent of others, even
of those who love you and whom you love."</p>

<p>Daily Conrad and Peter practiced on their
flute and drum. There were, as they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
hoped, other instruments on the ship and
a band was organized which played many
lively tunes. Sometimes the boys were allowed
to help with the furling of a sail or the
giving out of the supply of food and water.
They were shown by the friendly mate the
ship's store of arms and ammunition, a store
which seemed to their inexperienced eyes
sufficient to meet a whole fleet of pirates.</p>

<p>"If they would but come!" sighed Conrad
and Peter to themselves.</p>

<p>Presently John Conrad's watchful eyes saw
a new expression in the eyes of his oldest
daughter. She sat often by herself, and when
she joined the general company one of the
young men, Baer by name, was certain to put
himself as soon as possible by her side. John
Conrad sighed, scolded his son Conrad and
Peter Zenger for their constant punning on
the young man's name, and then took his own
medicine.</p>

<p>"They must leave me one by one," said he
to himself. "Magdalena will doubtless soon be
showing the same signs. Thank God, they can
start together in a land of peace and plenty!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>Through January all went well with the
pilgrims. Then Peter Zenger's father succumbed
to the disease with which he had been
afflicted. The end was sudden to no one but
Peter, who would not be comforted. To him
John Conrad talked when the solemn burial
was completed.</p>

<p>"You believe in God and Heaven, dear
child. Your father was worn and weary and
he is at rest until the last day. You are young
with life before you. You have your new
country; to it you must devote yourself, heart
and soul. The good God closes all gates sometimes
so that we may see the more plainly the
one through which He means we should go."</p>

<p>With the death of Zenger the character of
the journey changed. As the calm of the early
part of January had been extraordinary, so
now were the storms. There appeared one
morning along the western horizon a low
bank of clouds which the children took at
first, in wild enthusiasm, for land. As the
clouds rose higher and higher, the color of
the sea changed to a strange oily gray, and
suddenly the ship began to rock as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the waves were rising like the clouds. Now
a great wind whistled in the rigging with a
sound different from any which the passengers
had heard.</p>

<p>"What is it, father?" cried Sabina. "I am
afraid."</p>

<p>The Germans looked at one another ominously.</p>

<p>For many days there was no sitting about
the deck. No passenger was allowed, indeed,
to leave the hold of the ship. The vessel,
which had come to seem as solid as the earth,
was tossed about like a cork. Again and
again waves covered it, again and again with
sails closely furled it fought for its life. The
coverings of the hatchways were burst open
and the sea rushed in. Giving themselves up
many times for lost, the passengers tried to be
as brave as they could. Those who could keep
on their feet did all that lay in their power for
their companions, and through the intolerable
hours they prayed. When, once or twice during
the storm, the captain visited them, they
took courage from him.</p>

<p>"Conrad shall still catch a whale," said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in a voice which was cheerful through all
its weary hoarseness. "And Peter shall play
his drum, and the young maidens shall smile
upon the young men."</p>

<p>Finally the long storm died away. The
passengers were startled to realize that the
Lyon shook and quivered no longer, that
silence had succeeded the dreadful creaking
in the timbers and the fearful whistling in the
rigging, and that as the storm abated they
had each one fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Now followed many days of cold, bright
weather. Again the travelers sought the deck
and the sunshine. Peter Zenger was able to
remind Conrad one day, with a weak little
smile, of the advice given by the book of
directions.</p>

<p>"It would have taken a pretty lively swing
to prepare us for such a shaking," said he.</p>

<p>In a day or two Peter lifted his drum and
the band returned to its practicing. At
first they played solemn tunes; then, with
returning color to their cheeks, came fresh
cheerfulness and courage. Even the older
folk joined cheerfully in "Susy, dear Susy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
The sailors mended the sails, the girls took
out their knitting, and the children played
about on the deck.</p>

<p>But the whole-hearted gayety of the early
journey did not return. The great storm had
taken fearful toll, and there were already
twenty passengers less than there had been
at the beginning. The crowding of the ship
had become a serious menace to health. There
were a few sick persons at whom the captain
looked more anxiously than he had looked at
the angry clouds or the tempestuous sea.
Not the least of the dangers of the long journey
were various diseases, contagious and
deadly, which, once started, could scarcely
be checked.</p>

<p>Now another terrible peril threatened the
ship Lyon. The supply of food brought by
the passengers was entirely exhausted, and
that furnished by the ship was small in quantity
and hardly edible. The drinking-water
had become foul, and through a leak in one
of the wooden casks a large quantity had been
lost. Passengers and crew watched the sky
for a cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>When at last the cloud appeared, it was
accompanied again by the terrible wind and
the heaving sea of the great storm. Again the
passengers spent a week in the hold while
the ship battled with a tempest which broke
the rudder. Their respect for the captain and
the stanch vessel which carried them grew to
admiration and then to awe.</p>

<p>"It is no wonder they call the ship 'she,'"
said Conrad feebly. "One would think it was
alive. It is well named 'Lyon,' for it fights
for us like a lion."</p>

<p>Again the passengers returned to the deck,
more weak and miserable than before. The
supply of water gathered in the storm sank
lower and lower in the cask, the rations of
salt pork and sea biscuit became daily
smaller. Finally a day dawned when the
supply of water was gone and the supply of
food so low that starvation and death were
imminent. John Conrad went about from
group to group telling of the glories of the
heavenly country to which their passage
seemed now but the matter of a short
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came help. A faint speck appeared
upon the horizon. The children, when they
saw it, flew to the captain, who, they discovered,
had been watching it for an hour. It
grew larger and larger, not into the shape
of a rain cloud, but into the shape of a vessel.
Young Conrad guessed the nature of the
hope in the captain's eager eyes.</p>

<p>"Might they have food and water for us?"
The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"We cannot tell. They may be as badly
off as we are."</p>

<p>The ship came closer and closer, flying,
they saw joyfully, the pennant of England.
The passengers grew silent and eyes burned
and hearts almost ceased to beat. Presently
they were able to hear a shout across the
smooth sea. It was surely a friendly hail,
and still the ship came nearer and nearer.
Then the travelers heard, almost unbelieving,
the blessed words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We have potatoes and ground beans and
dried venison from Her Majesty's colony.
Do you wish to buy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," shouted the captain: "all you have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have water, also. Do you need any?"</p>

<p>To this replied a hurrah from every throat
on the ship Lyon.</p>

<p>"Thank God! Thank God!" cried the poor
Germans.</p>

<p>In a short time the water casks were aboard
and with them bags of vegetables and meat.
For several hours the ship stood near and the
sailors coming aboard the Lyon showed the
Germans how to roast the potatoes in an
open fire on the deck. Never had food tasted
so good and water so delicious. It was a
happy promise from the new country.</p>

<p>But the ship which brought this welcome
freight brought also bad news. The freebooters
along the coast were unusually active.
The captain of the Lyon must look well to his
guns. Everywhere in the ports of the new
country one heard of ships boarded, of treasure
taken, and of crew and passengers murdered
The more closely the vessel approached
the shores of America, the greater was the
danger.</p>

<p>The Germans looked at one another with
despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have suffered as much as we can
bear!" cried some one.</p>

<p>"We have no treasures," said John Conrad
to the captain. "Why should any one
molest people so poor as we are?"</p>

<p>"My ship would be a treasure for them,"
answered the captain. "For that they would
murder every soul on board."</p>

<p>Daily the passengers were assembled and
drilled. The crew was only sufficient to sail
the ship; for its defense the passengers would
have to be depended upon. They were instructed
in the firing of the cannon and informed
about the methods of pirates in attacking
a vessel.</p>

<p>"I have stood them off before," said the
captain, uneasily, to John Conrad. "But I
have always had more powder than I have
now and a few trained gunners. If they are
once aboard, we shall have to fight like tigers
for our lives. They give no quarter."</p>

<p>Now sabers and pistols were laid ready so
that there might be no confusion when the
pirate ship was sighted. The women and children
eyed the weapons fearfully; the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
tried to laugh at their alarm. No one but the
very youngest of the children slept the night
through.</p>

<p>But no pirate ship appeared. The air grew
softer and warmer; all began to breathe more
freely and to look ahead, not for the ship
of the dread enemy, but for the land. Eyes
of passengers and crew were weary of the
sea.</p>

<p>"They are afraid of our cross dogs," said
Conrad, half wishing, as the danger faded, for
a battle.</p>

<p>"Perhaps some brave captain has swept
them from the sea," said Peter. "That would
be a work I should like. I should board their
ships as they have boarded others and then I
should give no quarter."</p>

<p>At last, after the captain had declared the
danger past, and had jokingly bidden the boys
keep constant eyes upon the west for the
promised land, the sailor on watch gave a
loud cry:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ship, ahoy!"</p>

<p>At once the passengers crowded to the
prow of the boat. The approaching ship was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a tiny speck, visible only to the sharpest eyes.
For a long time it seemed to remain stationary;
then they realized that it was steadily
approaching. Children began to cry and
mothers to hold them closer and closer.</p>

<p>"It is coming very fast, is it not?" said
Conrad to the captain.</p>

<p>"Pretty fast."</p>

<p>"It is not necessarily a pirate ship," said
John Conrad. "It may be a friendly
ship."</p>

<p>"I believe it brings us good water and more
food," said Sabina.</p>

<p>"I am sure that I can see the English
flag," said George Frederick.</p>

<p>But the passengers were not allowed to
linger long at the prow speculating about the
strange vessel. Suddenly hopes were dashed
and all speculations and prophecies interrupted
by a sharp order from the captain.
Women and children were to go below and
each man was to take his place at once at the
post assigned him. The ammunition&mdash;a
perilously small store&mdash;was divided. Conrad
and Peter Zenger were the youngest pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>sengers
who were allowed to stay on deck.
They had been included in the drills, but for
them there was now neither gun nor powder.
They were given orders to keep out of the way
of the crew and the older men. If any of the
defenders fell, they might take their places.
The two boys crouched down close to the
mast, not venturing to go below to put away
the drum and flute upon which they had been
playing when the alarm was given.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the strange ship.
It was not so large as the Lyon, and it responded
far more quickly to its helm. In the
quickening breeze from the west it advanced
with great speed. It floated no pennant&mdash;the
wish of the Germans had been father to
the thought.</p>

<p>Now a sailor in the masthead of the Lyon
sent out a friendly hail. There was no answer.
Again the sailor shouted. Still there
was no reply. The crew of the Lyon could
see now plainly armed men upon the deck of
the stranger. The captain spoke in a whisper
to the mate.</p>

<p>"We have powder for two rounds. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
enough to keep them off for five minutes.
We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stranger seemed actually to leap
ahead, and the captain's eyes flashed. He
raised his hands before his mouth like a
trumpet.</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>The two cannon which pointed toward the
strange ship spit out a long streak of flame,
and the Lyon trembled with a terrific detonation.</p>

<p>When the smoke cleared away, it was
plainly to be seen that the pirates were not
frightened by the warning shots. The balls
had fallen short, and the pirate ship sailed
on, as though to take quick advantage of the
time required to reload the cannon. It was
now so near that the evil faces could be
clearly discerned upon its deck.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a><br />

THE PIRATE SHIP</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was small wonder that the passengers on
the Lyon were almost paralyzed with terror.
They were not soldiers, nor accustomed
to taking the part of soldiers, and they were
not fighting upon a battlefield, distant from
their loved ones, but close to them where the
danger threatened alike themselves and all
they held dear. The fact made them at once
more courageous and more terrified.</p>

<p>It was known by all that powder was short
and that the accuracy of the next shot would
probably decide their fate. Their hands grew
more and more awkward, their cheeks whiter.
Conrad and Peter sprang to their feet, seeing
plainly the panic on the faces of the gunners
who were trying to reload the cannon, and
upon the faces of the others who stood, saber
or pistol in hand, waiting for what seemed to
be certain destruction. One frightened soul
fired his pistol prematurely, another waved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
his saber wildly in the air. If the freebooters
saw, they must have anticipated an easy
victory.</p>

<p>"If we only had pistols!" cried Peter
shrilly.</p>

<p>The captain shouted fierce orders, and still
the gunners fumbled at their task.</p>

<p>Now Conrad ran to the captain's side. A
wild plan had suddenly occurred to him.</p>

<p>"We could play," cried he breathlessly,
"Peter and I. There was a trumpeter on a
castle wall who played and played till&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Play, then!"</p>

<p>With trembling lips and hands the two
boys began. The flute gave forth a sharp
piping, the drum tried to roar as fiercely as
the cannon. There was at first no tune, there
was at first, indeed, only a mad discord. And
still the pirate ship came on.</p>

<p>"Louder! Louder! Louder!" The boys did
not know whether they had heard or had
imagined the command. They were playing
"Susy, dear Susy," and playing it like a jig.
As though its sprightliness steadied them,
arms grew stronger, breath more even. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
gunners heard, the infantry heard, the women
and children shivering in the hold heard,
and best of all the evil men on the pirate
ship heard. The hands of the gunners trembled
a little less, the hands which held the
pistols and sabers grasped them more firmly,
the women and children looked with a tiny
bit of hope into one another's eyes, and the
pirates looked at one another with astonishment.</p>

<p>It may have been that the captain of the
pirate ship did not care to try conclusions
with a force which could spare men to play
the drum and flute; it may have been that he
could observe that the firing of the second
shot was the matter of only a second or two;
or it may have been that merely the lively
defiance of "Susy, dear Susy," discouraged
him. At any rate, he altered the course of his
vessel. When the second shot sailed after
him, he had darted out of range.</p>

<p>At first the passengers of the Lyon stared
as though a spell had been put upon them.
A moment ago they had been in danger of
their lives; now they were safe while the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>emy
sailed away. Some laughed aloud, others
wiped their eyes, and a sailor flung open the
hatchway and shouted the good news to the
anxious hearts below.</p>

<p>Though the distance between the Lyon
and her enemy grew wider and wider until
presently the stranger had vanished over the
horizon's edge, the sailors kept watch until
nightfall.</p>

<p>But the passengers gave no thought now to
an enemy. They saw, late in the afternoon,
a sailor lowering the sounding-line over the
ship's side. They had watched this process
many times. But the earnestness of the sailor
and the eager watching of his companions
gave it a new significance. Into the group at
the ship's edge young Conrad forced his way.</p>

<p>"How much?" said he.</p>

<p>The sailors paid no attention and Conrad
concluded to wait. Presently the line was
drawn in and the sailor announced to the
captain in a loud voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thirty-five fathoms, sir."</p>

<p>"That is shallow," said Conrad. "Is there
any danger?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The sailors laughed.</p>

<p>"There is danger of seeing land to-morrow,"
said one.</p>

<p>To this no one made any reply for a long
moment. Then another shout arose like the
one which had greeted the arrival of water
and food. In one moment the news
had spread: in another, though the captain
laughed, the women were descending to pack
boxes and to tie up the bundles in the hold.</p>

<p>But no one stayed long below the deck.
Margareta and Magdalena with one bundle
packed climbed back to look toward the west.
John Conrad's expectation was being realized;
there was now a young man by the side of
Magdalena also. The captain laughed at
them for watching for land as he laughed at
them for packing.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, my children, not to-day.
You may look your eyes out to-day and you
will see nothing, and there will be plenty of
time after we see land for you to pack your
clothes."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Germans looked and
looked, though, as the captain prophesied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
they saw nothing. But they would not leave
their place in the bow. Sitting together, they
reviewed the journey and the more distant
past. They spoke of the Fatherland, of those
left behind who might some day follow them,
like George Reimer, of those, like the magistrate
of Oberdorf, whom they should never
see again, and of those already on the way in
other ships. They spoke also in quiet voices
of those who slept, like the mother of the
Weisers, in quiet graveyards. They spoke of
bondage and liberty and of war and peace and
of a strange new freedom, of which there was
in the hearts of a few a dim conception, like
the tiny seed of a mighty tree. They spoke
with gratitude of the good Queen and offered
a prayer for her, and for other friends, like
the good helmsman on the river boat. They
spoke of the strange red people, and Conrad
must find his little book and read once more
of their skill as hunters, of their devotion in
friendship and of their ferocity in war and in
revenge. Longest of all they talked of the
King of Rivers and his companions.</p>

<p>"It is my object to find them first of all,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
said Conrad. "I am sure they are looking
for us to come to the country which they gave
us."</p>

<p>Once again must Conrad and Peter and the
rest of the band play their old tunes, grave
and gay, mournful and lively; once again
must all join in song. Twilight came and then
the starry, summer night, and still the pilgrims
sat gazing toward the west. All night a
few kept vigil.</p>

<p>At daylight every one was on deck. The
morning dawned in splendor, but no one
turned to watch the rising sun. At last, when
the bright rays illuminated the whole of earth
and heaven, they saw through tears the low
shores of the promised land.</p>

<p>But now that land was in sight, the Lyon
was not able to get into the harbor. Already
as the passengers watched the shore a storm
was rising. It was not so severe as those
which had gone before nor so long continued,
but it was far more alarming since the ship
was now in danger of being cast upon the
reefs. It seemed for many days that the passengers
had endured all for naught. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
like being sent back into mid-ocean to suffer
once more all the fearful trials through which
they had lived. Again the captain grew wan
and hollow-eyed, again the travelers lived for
days in the hold of the ship, again there was
sickness and death. Some of those who had
seen the promised land saw it no more, nor
any earthly land. There was no concealing
the fact that those who were ill had ship
fever, which was almost certain, in the conditions
in which the patients had to live, to
be fatal. Little John Frederick, the youngest
of the Weisers, about whose health they
had long felt anxiety, grew worse, so that his
brothers and sisters could not look at him
without tears. Still the pilgrims were patient
and kind, still they tried not to murmur at
this new dispensation of Providence.</p>

<p>"Courage!" said John Conrad a dozen
times a day, to himself, as well as to his companions.
"Many a good enterprise has failed
because those who undertook it could not
endure quite to the end."</p>

<p>The pilgrims were to have, alas, need for all
the courage and patience which they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
summon. When a long swell succeeded the
fierce beating of the waves and the skies
cleared, they sought the deck once more, and
hurried to the prow. There they stared at one
another in amazement and terror. The promised
land at which they had looked with such
longing eyes had vanished.</p>

<p>"What has become of it?" asked a bewildered
company.</p>

<p>"It is still exactly where it was," answered
the captain. "It is we who have changed our
place."</p>

<p>"When shall we see it again?"</p>

<p>The captain reassured them with a cheerfulness
which he did not feel. The ship had
been driven far out of its course; it would
take many days to win again a view of the
low-lying shores.</p>

<p>It was now June. Unless conditions in the
new world were very different from those in
the old, the season for planting was almost
passed: and John Conrad's eagerness to be
settled grew to anxiety. Whatever young
Conrad's book might say about the strength
of the sun in America, it was certain that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
pilgrims must have a house and some stores
of food and fuel with which to meet the winter.
Again they gazed toward the west until,
between the blinding glare of the sun on the
smooth sea and their own tears, they could
see no more.</p>

<p>But like all evils in the world the long journey
came to an end. The travelers had given
up rising before dawn to watch the first beams
of the sun strike on the western shores, when
one bright morning a shout awoke them.</p>

<p>"Land! Land! Land!" Though it needed
but one call to rouse the sleepers, the sailor
called a dozen times, as though the joyful
news could not be too often proclaimed.</p>

<p>The travelers crowded on deck; they saw
the shore much nearer at hand than it had
been before, and green instead of a dull, indeterminate
color; they were surrounded by
fluttering birds; they sniffed upon the air
a different odor, an odor of land and growing
things. Then with one accord their eyes
sought the sky to see if once more a cloud
threatened them.</p>

<p>But there was no cloud even so large as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
man's hand, and the dangerous reefs were
passed safely.</p>

<p>"But we are not moving!" cried young
Conrad. "What is the matter?"</p>

<p>The captain pointed ahead, and Conrad
saw a long rowboat cutting the water.</p>

<p>"We can't go into the harbor without a
pilot," said the captain. "Here he comes."</p>

<p>Indifferent to the fact that their belongings
were, after all their planning, not ready to be
carried to the shore, the passengers hung over
the side of the ship. There was a loud hail
from the little boat, and an answering shout
from the captain of the Lyon.</p>

<p>Suddenly Conrad cried out and seized his
father by the arm.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!"</p>

<p>"What is it, lad?"</p>

<p>Then John Conrad saw for himself. The
rowers were dark-skinned, black-haired creatures
whose great bare bodies gleamed in the
sun. The King of Rivers and his friends had
been blanketed, but there was no mistaking
these for any but men of their race.</p>

<p>"They are Indians," said Conrad, in awe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Now a rope ladder was flung over the side
of the ship and the pilot came aboard. He
shook hands with the captain and the mate,
and then lifted from the hands of an Indian
who had followed him a roughly woven basket.</p>

<p>"I always bring something for the birds,"
said he in a loud voice as he uncovered it.</p>

<p>For a moment both children and adults
could only stare at him dumbly. He was
real, he came from America, and America had
begun to seem like the figment of a dream:
his was a new face, and they had seen no new
faces for months.</p>

<p>But when the children looked into his basket,
they ran forward. Here were cherries
for mouths which had forgotten the taste of
fruit; here were strawberries for lips which
had never touched strawberries. An old woman
began to weep.</p>

<p>"Cherries like those in the gardens of
Württemberg, God be thanked!"</p>

<p>John Conrad looked at the pilot a little
uneasily.</p>

<p>"We cannot pay," said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>The pilot popped a strawberry into the
mouth of John Frederick.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said he, "you are in a land of
plenty. To-morrow when I come to take you
in I will bring more."</p>

<p>"To-morrow!" echoed a dozen voices.
"Oh, sir, can we not go in to-day?"</p>

<p>The pilot shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not till to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But the storm came before and drove us
far away."</p>

<p>"No storm will drive you away now."</p>

<p>With sinking hearts the pilgrims saw the
pilot descend again over the side of the ship
and enter his boat and row away.</p>

<p>"I do not believe he will return," said one
despairing soul.</p>

<p>But in a few minutes the speaker and every
one else on board had begun to pack. Pots
and dishes, pans and kettles, clothes, a few
spinning-wheels, the few treasured books&mdash;all
were boxed or wrapped or corded together.
The Weisers, remembering gayly that they
had once made nine bundles for eight persons,
made careful division of their belongings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"The spinning-wheel is not here and dear
Wolf is not here, but we have everything
else," said Margareta.</p>

<p>"Including a tame bear," ventured Conrad,
knowing that there would be no boxing
of ears to-day.</p>

<p>To the laughing astonishment of the travelers,
the pilot was on the deck in the morning
when they came up to greet the sun. He rallied
them upon their laziness and passed out
another gift of fruit, and then took command
of the ship. To the keen disappointment of
the boys the Indians did not come on board,
but were towed in their rowboat.</p>

<p>Past the low shores of Long Island, nearer
and nearer to the village of New York moved
the Lyon, more and more excited grew the
pilgrims.</p>

<p>"I can see houses!"</p>

<p>"And smoke rising from chimneys!"</p>

<p>"And men walking about!"</p>

<p>"There is a wharf with people on it!"</p>

<p>"We are here at last, at last!"</p>

<p>Some one started a hymn and a single stanza
was sung. Then voices failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>John Conrad stood silently, his older children
close to him and little John Frederick in
his arms. With them was Peter Zenger, his
arm round Conrad's neck. John Conrad saw
the house and the people and the strange
shore, and the certainty of impending change
swept over him. These&mdash;his boys and girls&mdash;what
would befall them? They were his
now, but the new land must divide them from
him. Each must do his work. Already the
sound of voices drifted to him from this alien
shore. He longed to put into one sentence all
his love and hope. With brimming eyes he
looked at his little flock for whom he had
made the long journey, for whom he had forgotten
sadness and heartache.</p>

<p>"Children," he said. "Margareta and
Magdalena and Sabina and Conrad&mdash;"
John Conrad's voice faltered. In a moment
he began once more with a new message.
"Children,&mdash;George and Christopher and
Barbara and little John and dear Peter,&mdash;here
is now your Fatherland."</p>

THE HOME ASSIGNED</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Close</span> together the Weisers stepped from
the gangplank of the Lyon. Their question
as to what they were to do was soon
solved by their prompt shepherding from the
wharf into small boats by the officers of the
port.</p>

<p>"Where do we go?" asked John Conrad
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"There has been ship fever on the Lyon,"
answered some one. "You go to Nuttall's
Island."</p>

<p>Like millions to follow them, the Germans
soon gazed from Nuttall's Island across the
bay. They were given little houses to live
in, and as the magistrate of Oberdorf had
greeted them on Blackheath, they greeted
presently their friends from the other ships.
There were happy reunions, there were stories
of death and danger by sea, there was the
common hope of better things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>When the cool winds of September began
to blow and they were still waiting to be released
from what seemed like captivity, the
Germans became impatient and then frightened.
They wished to set to work so that they
might the sooner finish their task of tar-making
and begin to labor on their own account.
During the long journey boys and girls had
grown up; like Conrad, other boys longed for
adventure, and like Margareta, other young
women wished to begin the establishment of
a home. Among the Germans there was suddenly
a new spirit of independence. Here was
not the goal for which they had striven.</p>

<p>"The Governor has not completed his arrangements,"
said John Conrad to his impatient
countrymen.</p>

<p>"Then let us go to that Schoharie which
the Indians gave us." Conrad spoke for all
the younger Germans.</p>

<p>"We are bound to make tar," reminded
John Conrad, who looked at his son in amazement.</p>

<p>Presently came Governor Hunter, who had
crossed the ocean in one of the last ships of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the fleet. His visit, so eagerly expected, had
a sorrowful outcome. From one end of the
settlement to the other he walked and at the
cabin of John Conrad he paused.</p>

<p>"You are to go soon to Livingston Manor
to begin your work. You are the man who
was in the Queen's audience room. I depend
upon you to be a good influence among your
fellows." His bright gaze traveled from
child to child. "You have a large family."</p>

<p>Before John Conrad could answer, young
Conrad stepped from the doorway, disregarding
his father's frown.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I wish we might go to Schoharie!"</p>

<p>Governor Hunter looked at him coldly.</p>

<p>"You will go where I send you."</p>

<p>When the Governor had gone, his agent
announced a startling command which he
had left. Among the Germans were too many
children. In New York and on Long Island
were farmers and merchants who needed
help. To them the orphans and some other
young lads must be apprenticed.</p>

<p>"Not our children!" cried Magdalena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>John Conrad shook his head ominously.
He had counted his children over before he
left the ship,&mdash;was separation to come so
soon? That evening he admonished gentle
Christopher and grave George Frederick
tenderly and solemnly.</p>

<p>"We must submit to the Governor's will,"
said he. "My little lads know what is right.
To do right is all that is required of them."</p>

<p>The next day boats anchored at Nuttall's
Island and from them stepped English and
Dutch farmers and their wives. Upon the
heads of Christopher and George Frederick
were laid a pair of plump hands.</p>

<p>"These I would like," said a kind voice.</p>

<p>The eager eyes of the Weiser family gazed
through tears.</p>

<p>"Both together?" asked John Conrad
thickly.</p>

<p>"Both together," answered the farmer's
wife. "We have a good farm and no children."
When she saw that little Christopher
cried, she put her hand into the deep pocket
in the skirt of her husband's coat and drew
out a bar of maple sugar, the only candy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the colonies. "I put something in my pocket
for my new children." Then she sat down on
the rough bench before the little door. "The
boats will not go back for a long time to
come. In the mean time we will talk."</p>

<p>Now more tears were shed, but they were
not bitter tears. The English of the Weisers
was broken, but it sufficed to relate the sad
history of Gross Anspach, the kindness of
George Reimer, the cruel cold on Blackheath,
and the dangers of the sea. When the time
for parting came, the Weisers trooped to the
boats. Peter Zenger was to go also, with a
brisk printer, Bradford by name. Hands were
waved until they could wave no longer; then
the Weisers turned back to their little hut.</p>

<p>"Two are gone," said John Conrad, bewildered.
"My dear children! My dear
children!" Then poor John Conrad burst
once more into tears.</p>

<p>When in November twelve hundred of the
four thousand Germans who had left Blackheath
ascended the Hudson River, there was
another grievous parting. Margareta's young
man had found work in New York, but until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
he earned a little he and Margareta could not
marry. One of the Weisers, at least, looked
back instead of forward as the heavily laden
boats made their slow way up the stream.
Conrad wished to stay also and find work,
but neither the Governor's agent nor his
father would give him permission. The
agent, Cast by name, was sharp of tongue,
and with him the young men had begun to
dispute. Others like Conrad were strong of
will and hot of temper. In the long period of
waiting, gratitude to the English had somewhat
faded.</p>

<p>The arrival at the new home was dreary.
Upon the stretch of forest in which the settlement
was to be made there was only the
agent's comfortable log house. It was late
afternoon when the pilgrims were put ashore.
At sight of the unimproved and repellent
spot they looked at one another in dismay.</p>

<p>"Is it for this that we have come so far?"</p>

<p>John Conrad began again his old work of
encouragement.</p>

<p>"At last we have work to do. By night we
must have some sort of shelter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day substantial houses of logs began
to rise among the tall pine trees. John
Conrad's suspicions about his second daughter
proved to be true. Quiet Magdalena and
the young man upon whom she had smiled
announced that they, too, would build a
house.</p>

<p>Then, when houses were built and logs were
burning in the great chimneys, the Germans
waited idly. Tar-making was not to begin,
it seemed, until spring. Again John Conrad
counseled patience.</p>

<p>"We are here, we cannot get away and,
moreover, we have given our word. We are
fed and clothed. In the spring things will
be better. We cannot expect everything at
once."</p>

<p>Young Conrad answered sharply.</p>

<p>"The men say that this land will never be
good farming land, father. After the pine
trees are cut, we shall have nothing. I would
find that Schoharie which the Indians gave
us. There is our home."</p>

<p>John Conrad shook his head.</p>

<p>"We must have patience," said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>Slowly the winter passed. In the cold of
January little John Frederick, so loved and
cherished, died, and was the first of the colony
to be buried in the new land.</p>

<p>"Now," said John Conrad, "it is our land,
indeed."</p>

<p>In April Magdalena was married by a
clergyman who came from the older German
settlement across the river. The wedding
was merry: even Margareta, who had heard
but once from her lover, put anxiety away
and smiled and danced the old-fashioned
dances of Gross Anspach weddings. When
Magdalena had gone to the little log house
with her husband, John Conrad sat before his
door.</p>

<p>"She has done well. Now of nine, only four
are left me."</p>

<p>Once during the winter Conrad saw an
Indian. The tall figure crossed the end of a
little glade and as fast as he could Conrad
pursued it. But the Indian had vanished;
there was neither sound nor motion in the
still forest. Gradually, their lands taken from
them, themselves often ill-treated, the Indians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
were withdrawing from the neighborhood of
the settlements.</p>

<p>In great excitement Conrad hurried to his
father.</p>

<p>"Father, I have seen an Indian. Let us
ask him to guide us to Schoharie!"</p>

<p>"We are not permitted to go."</p>

<p>"Let us go without permission. I can
fight, father."</p>

<p>Again John Conrad regarded his son with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"We have come for peace, not for war.
God knows we have suffered enough from
war! Let me hear no more of such madness,
Conrad, and sit no more with the young men,
but with your sisters."</p>

<p>In the early spring tools were given out for
the cutting of the pine trees and slashes were
made in the tough bark so that the sap might
gather. In two years the trees would be felled
and burned in kilns.</p>

<p>In the early summer came a new command.
Over the great continent evil forces were
astir. Like the bent bow, the line of the
French and their allied Indians stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
from Montreal to New Orleans, its curve
including the Mississippi; like the string
within stretched the English line. There was
conflict at Montreal where the Five Nations
were true to their English alliance, and
thither the Germans were to go in three companies.
At once they forgot their wrongs and
willingly they started, John Conrad in command
of a company.</p>

<p>The Germans gave the Queen little help,
not because they were not willing and able,
but because the short campaign was almost
over. They marched back as they had come,
congratulating themselves upon the pay they
would receive for military service. At last
they could buy a few spinning-wheels and
perhaps a horse and cow.</p>

<p>But the Governor's agent laughed.</p>

<p>"Does a man pay extra to his servants?"</p>

<p>"You did not give us our due food while
they were away!" cried young Conrad.</p>

<p>The agent shook his fist.</p>

<p>"Return your arms and get back to your
work!"</p>

<p>When the arms were returned, a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
guns were lacking. The older Germans were
clearly puzzled, but the guns could not be
found.</p>

<p>In a week the Governor came again to visit
his colony. His shoulders were bent and his
countenance had changed. The good Queen
was dead and the support promised for his
cherished enterprise of tar-making came
slowly from her successor. To the Governor
appealed now the leading men of the settlement.
Perhaps it was the cruel contrast between
his magnificence and their rags which
made him at first willing to listen and to conciliate.</p>

<p>As John Conrad had talked bravely and
simply to the Queen, so he spoke to the Governor.
The oldest of the settlers shared by
this time the discontent of the young men.</p>

<p>"It is almost a year since we came and we
have done nothing for ourselves. Even if we
can make tar, we are not advanced because
this land is not farming land. We beg to be
allowed to go to that country which the Indians
gave us, where we can have permanent
homes. Is there no pine there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>The Governor made no answer.</p>

<p>"And we would have pay for our service
as soldiers. We are very poor, as you can
see, and soldiering was not in our bargain."</p>

<p>The Governor smiled as his agent had
smiled.</p>

<p>"You will serve yourself and your friends
best by counseling obedience," said he. "You
cannot go away."</p>

<p>When the Governor had gone, his agent
walked down the street of the settlement. In
his path stood young Conrad, who forgot
once more his father's admonitions.</p>

<p>"The Germans have guns, sir," said Conrad.</p>

<p>Cast returned at once to his house. In a
moment his servant was riding rapidly along
the river-bank to intercept the Governor at
the next settlement, twenty miles away.</p>

<p>"I am charged with a message to Your
Honor," he cried breathlessly at sight of the
Governor. "The German people are armed.
Our lives are not safe."</p>

<p>The Governor sailed up the river once
more. When he reached Livingston Manor, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
was dark and the Germans knew nothing of
his coming nor of the prompt departure of
the agent's servant through the forest to the
north. The next afternoon they were called
together. To their amazement the Governor
appeared. In a stern voice he read a contract
to them.</p>

<p>"But that is not our contract," protested
a mystified John Conrad. "We&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Governor waved them from his presence.</p>

<p>"It is your contract. Think over your
situation and return to-morrow."</p>

<p>That evening the older Germans talked
earnestly in the Weiser house. They agreed
to ask again that they be permitted to leave
and that they be paid. But to resist they
were helpless. Resistance, moreover, was
wrong.</p>

<p>For a while Conrad listened; then he joined
a score of young men who waited for him outside
in the shadow.</p>

<p>"It is all for peace," said he. "I believe that
Governor Hunter means to entrap them."</p>

<p>Quietly the young men slipped into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
darker woods. Into a little cave high above
the river, Conrad crept on hands and knees.
One by one he passed out a dozen guns.
Though the leader of the enterprise was the
youngest of all, his friends looked at him
with admiration. In their admiration Conrad
forgot his own somewhat troublesome conscience.</p>

<p>In the morning, John Conrad and his
friends visited the Governor. They had, they
said, considered their situation, and they were
not satisfied.</p>

<p>The Governor looked over their heads in
the direction of Albany.</p>

<p>"We do not wish to be undutiful," explained
John Conrad. "What we ask is only
justice. We did not promise to stay forever
in a barren land." John Conrad's voice
trembled as it had trembled in Gross Anspach
when he spoke of the country which they had
seen in their dreams. "We wish to go to
Schoharie."</p>

<p>"Whether or not you 'wish to go to Schoharie,'"
the Governor mocked them like a
child, "you are to stay here." Now the Gov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>ernor
stamped his foot. "Here is your land,
here you are to live and die!"</p>

<p>The agent could not resist a temptation to
add a word.</p>

<p>"You should be shot for your impertinence!"</p>

<p>Then the agent gave a wild scream. The
punishment which he proposed so angrily
seemed likely to be carried into effect upon
himself. Upon the little house he saw an
armed host approaching. Waiting for sound
of strife, the young men had come to the defense
of their elders.</p>

<p>"They will murder us!" screamed the
agent.</p>

<p>Young Conrad stepped inside the door.</p>

<p>"We ask only&mdash;" Then Conrad paused.
Neither the Governor nor the agent was
listening to what he was saying. Even the
eyes of his father, which had looked upon
him with horrified amazement, were turned
away. From the young men behind him came
a loud warning to run, and he turned his
head. Among the trees was a gleam of red
and a glitter of steel. The agent's servant had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
made a swift trip to the British garrison at
Albany.</p>

<p>"Captain, collect these guns," commanded
the Governor. Then he turned to young Conrad.
"Another stirring-up of rebellion and
you will pay the penalty of a rebel."</p>

<p>Now the Germans gave up their arms and
went back to their work. Some of the trees
were said to be fit for felling and a few kilns
were constructed. In these the pine knots
were first to be burned. To the task of gathering
them the little children were appointed
and Conrad was made their superintendent.
The work was humiliating and he obeyed unwillingly.
His father had said nothing to him
of his rebellion, but he knew that it was constantly
in John Conrad's mind. The presence
of the red-coated soldiers, who treated the
whole settlement like dangerous criminals,
was, John Conrad may have thought, reproach
enough.</p>

<p>Now another winter came and passed, a
winter of idleness and discontent for Conrad,
of sadness for Margareta, and of great physical
suffering for all. The miserable substi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>tutes
for woolen clothes, the poor food, the
bitter cold weakened their bodies and depressed
their minds. No longer could Conrad
enliven the camp with music, since his
dear flute had to be exchanged for food. The
Governor's agent now played upon it, but he
played no German tunes. Barbara and Sabina
grew as pale and thin as their older sister,
whose hopes of seeing her lover had almost
died. Once more as on shipboard John Conrad
thought and spoke of the beauties of the
heavenly country.</p>

<p>Presently John Conrad was served with an
astonishing notice. The Germans might go!
Hearts leaped; there were cries of joy. Then
the hand which held the order began to
tremble.</p>

<p>"We may go south or east, but not north
or west. To Schoharie we dare not go. It is
my opinion that this business of tar-making
has failed. It cannot be that they will turn
us adrift and yet forbid us that which is ours.
God in heaven help us!"</p>

<p>To the confused and terrified settlement
came another fearful threat. No longer, said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the Governor, would he feed women or children
who had no men to repay him in labor.
A few single men married at once their young
countrywomen who were without support.
Among them was John Conrad.</p>

<p>The summer passed in uncertainty. In
September another notice came. The business
of tar-making was for the present ended.
The Germans would receive no more food,
but must shift for themselves. With cruel
thoroughness they were now abandoned.</p>

<p>"And we dare not go to Schoharie!" they
cried. "Last week Kniskern tried to get
away and the soldiers brought him back.
We&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then upon the frightened assembly rushed
young Conrad.</p>

<p>"The soldiers are gone!"</p>

<p>With one accord the council adjourned,
running to the upper end of the settlement.
The camp-ground was deserted.</p>

<p>Now it was proposed that the settlement
should start as a body with the dawn. At
this poor Margareta burst into tears. In the
wilderness her young man could never find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
her. It had been some small comfort to feel
that at least he knew where she was.</p>

<p>But Margareta was to have a little longer
to watch and wait. Once more the dissuading
voice of John Conrad warned his companions.</p>

<p>"My friends! We do not know where this
land is. A few chosen men must make their
way thither in the two rude boats owned by
the settlers, and consult with the Indians and
return. At Albany we might find a guide. It
is the only way."</p>

<p>For hours the council sat in the Weiser
house. It was agreed that seven men should
start in the morning. Conrad sat listening,
his eyes looking through the log walls, across
the blue river, his heart longing to see once
more those great warriors, his friends. When
the council had adjourned, he caught his
father by the arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, let me go, too!"</p>

<p>"We dare not take more than are necessary,
lad."</p>

<p>"I will be wise and patient, father."</p>

<p>"You have yet to prove yourself to be so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Conrad." John Conrad looked gravely into
the beseeching eyes. "Your time of responsibility
will come, lad; see that you are ready
for it."</p>

THE FLIGHT BEGINS</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Though</span> Conrad was not allowed to go
to Schoharie with his father and the
other deputies, he was allowed to see them on
their way. The evening following the council
at which their plans were made, the moon
rose late, a fact which suited their purposes.</p>

<p>"We can slip away in the darkness, and
still have the moon to light our journey," said
John Conrad. "It may be that they are
watching us. There will be two boats, and
these must be brought back, since we may
find a shorter path through the forest when
we return."</p>

<p>Conrad's blue eyes lifted to his father's in
appeal.</p>

<p>"Let me go with you and bring the boats
back. I can row well and I will be very careful."</p>

<p>John Conrad consulted with his friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
When they said "yes," Conrad rushed to get
ready.</p>

<p>The journey to Albany consumed three
days. Here and there, where the banks of the
river were low, the travelers saw fine farms
which they longed to possess. They did not
dare to stop, however, to inspect the land,
since it seemed to them that they could hear
on every breeze the sound of pursuers, bidding
them return to the slavery which was
worse than death. There were no villages and
they passed but few boats. If they were
hailed, Conrad answered in the best English
he could muster.</p>

<p>Albany was only a small settlement, but
here was stationed the garrison of soldiers
from which the company had been sent to
subdue the Germans, and therefore recognition
and arrest were easily possible. The
two boats were beached late in the afternoon
below the town, and here the deputies hid
until nightfall.</p>

<p>When darkness came Conrad, rowing one
boat and towing the other, dropped quietly
downstream with the current. In a thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
wood to which his father had pointed him on
the upward journey, he stayed alone during
the warm September night. He was tired, but
it was a long time before he could go to sleep.
He heard a gentle wind moving the treetops;
he heard a twig snap near by, as though some
wild creature were coming closer and closer
with sinister intent. Several times he sprang
to his feet. When the dim landscape appeared
unchanged and without living inhabitants, he
lay down once more.</p>

<p>Still he could not sleep. His thoughts
traveled to Livingston Manor with its cruel
disappointments, to the long ocean journey,
to Blackheath, even to Gross Anspach. What
vague, splendid dreams he had had of the
future and of the new land! He had dreamed
of becoming rich and powerful and important,
and all he had succeeded in doing was gathering
a few pine knots! Remembering that
childish service, he laughed bitterly. If his
father had given him his way he might have
done better, but his father would not believe
that he was a man. Then, before more dreary
thoughts came to depress him, he fell asleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
his head pillowed on his arm, his weary body
finding the hard ground a downy bed.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he continued his journey
down the river, his eyes watching carefully
for enemies. But no emissaries of an
angry Governor came to meet him. The Germans
were, it was plainly evident, wholly
abandoned to their misery. Past the tall cliffs,
past the open farmlands, where some day
would be pleasant villages and towns, he
floated. He was hungry, but he had been
hungry many times; he was tired, but he did
not mind weariness.</p>

<p>At the settlement he found all as it had
been. The soldiers had not returned and the
agent had vanished. A hundred plans were
being made for the journey into the wilderness.
A few families announced that they
would not go. The Governor would not forsake
them utterly; if he did, they would rather
seek for help among their fellow countrymen
across the river than trust themselves to the
forest.</p>

<p>In Albany, the deputies sought out quietly
the German families whom they knew and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
from their houses were able to make inquiries.
That there was an Indian settlement of Schoharie
was certain. There were at that time
in Albany several Mohawk Indians from the
neighborhood of Schenectady, another Indian
village, who could answer questions. With
one, whom the English called John Meyndert,
the deputies talked before the day was over.
With grunts and nods he promised to be their
guide and interpreter, and in his canoe and
the canoe of another Indian they traveled to
Schenectady, where, after a night's rest, they
started across a line of rough hills toward the
southwest.</p>

<p>Of the beauties of the September woods the
seven deputies saw nothing. With eyes fixed
upon the man in front, each man walked doggedly
and stubbornly on, determined not to
yield to the fatigue which the rapid pace produced.
Soft of tread and sure of foot John
Meyndert stalked ahead as silent as the tree
trunks among which he moved. An occasional
"Ugh" when the slipping foot of one of the
travelers threatened an ugly fall, or a shake of
the head when some one pointed to a fruit or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
berry which looked as though it were edible,
formed his share of the conversation.</p>

<p>At last, at noon of a pleasant day, Meyndert
halted his long stride and pointed downward.
They had reached and crossed a rough
elevation whose loose stones made it almost
impossible to climb. Now, wearily, the deputies
lifted their eyes toward Meyndert and
followed his pointing finger.</p>

<p>It was John Conrad who cried out first.</p>

<p>"Oh, see!"</p>

<p>In a second the last of the party had come
out on the little shelf of rock to which Meyndert
had led them. Peter Kniskern pointed
with a shaking hand.</p>

<p>"Schoharie?"</p>

<p>The Indian answered with a grin.</p>

<p>Then, for a long time, no one spoke a word,
and no one moved except to wipe from his
eyes the tears of which middle age had learned
not to be ashamed.</p>

<p>The smiling valley lay before them,
threaded through its broad plain with the
river now in flood. Here where they stood
the banks rose precipitously; yonder there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
was a more gradual ascent; but on every side
the broad valley was sheltered. The travelers
looked their fill, then one by one gave judgment
in slow sentences.</p>

<p>"Those are rich and fertile meadows."</p>

<p>"See this fine spring below us!"</p>

<p>"How quickly would fruit trees grow and
vineyards cover the hillsides!"</p>

<p>"It is like"&mdash;the voice sank to a whisper&mdash;"it
is like the valleys of Germany!"</p>

<p>As they descended the steep hill, Meyndert
pointed out the Indian village at the far end
of the valley. It was a time of year when food
was abundant and the villages were comfortable.
As the visitors approached, children
dashed for cover in the neat wigwams set on
each side of a narrow street, and women, busy
with baking or weaving, looked up in amazement.
Toward the tallest of the wigwams,
Meyndert led his company. In its doorway
sat two Indians smoking, at sight of whom he
called a loud "Ho!" For a while the three
talked together while the Germans waited,
aware from Meyndert's gestures that he was
telling their errand. Presently, in response to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a shout, several Indian women brought bearskins
and deerskins from the wigwam and
spread them down under a great tree. Thither
the Germans were led, and there they and the
three Indians sat down.</p>

<p>At once Meyndert pointed to one of his
hosts, enormous of body and painted with
snakes and arrows. He called him, as nearly
as the Germans could understand, "Quagnant."
Quagnant came, so Meyndert indicated
by broken sentences and gestures, from
a valley beyond. He was a chief over the
Indians in this valley as well as his own. He
delivered now a long speech, whose meaning
Meyndert made fairly clear. He spoke very
formally and solemnly after the manner of the
Indian people. He and his friends would be
glad to have the strangers come among them.
He had heard of the wonderful journey of the
King of Rivers and other great chiefs who were
overlords in the Five Nations, but he did not
know what had befallen them or whether they
had returned, since they lived far, far to the
west. He was sorry that these new brethren
had been so afflicted. Here they might have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
if they wished, a peaceful haven. His people
would help them with food and skins and
show them how to build their houses.</p>

<p>Having finished his speech to the happy
Germans, Quagnant commanded that a feast
be made. Together all ate solemnly of Indian
bread and smoked meat, and took great
whiffs from a long pipe lighted and passed by
Quagnant. Then, supplied with food for the
journey and with light hearts, the Germans
started for Schenectady.</p>

<p>From Schenectady to Albany the Indians
took the travelers in their canoes, then the
Germans set out on foot, keeping as near the
river as possible. They had traveled for a day
when they heard a shout, and looking down
saw two rowboats, one containing a passenger,
the other towed. With an answering
shout they descended the rocky bank to the
shore.</p>

<p>"I have been watching and watching,"
cried Conrad. "Have you been to Schoharie?
What did you find? Did you see our friends?"</p>

<p>When a score of questions had tumbled out
one after the other, the deputies began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
answer. Schoharie was beautiful and fertile
beyond all their dreams. The Indians were
not only willing to let them have the land, but
offered to help them. They had seen nothing
of the King of Rivers, but had heard of
him.</p>

<p>"They have houses of bark in which they
seem to be comfortable, but better houses can
easily be made."</p>

<p>"They are satisfied with what they have;
therefore Fate has no power over them. If
their property is destroyed, they have a great
storehouse to draw from for more."</p>

<p>"They made a feast for us and gave us
food."</p>

<p>Conrad's blue eyes sought his father's.</p>

<p>"When will we start?"</p>

<p>For an instant John Conrad rowed in silence.
His plans would not suit Conrad, the
lad who was so young and who thought himself
so old, who felt that so little time was
still his, and who had a lifetime before him.</p>

<p>"Some will start at once, Conrad. But we
will stay in Schenectady until the winter is
over. There I have made arrangements with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
John Meyndert to keep us, and there we will
try to earn a little."</p>

<p>Conrad made no answer. He had already
seen himself the first of the pilgrims to burst
into the quiet valley.</p>

<p>"We shall find peace at last," went on John
Conrad. "This Quagnant said no one should
molest us, that the land is ours."</p>

<p>In a few days twenty families started for
Schoharie. It was late October and already
there had been sharp frost. The journey must
be made slowly, since there were little children
and ailing women in the party. A few
had boats for the first part of the way and the
others walked along the river-bank, the rustling
leaves beneath their feet giving warning
of the winter which was rapidly approaching.
Hope minimized the dangers and smoothed
the rough path.</p>

<p>A little later the Weisers started for Schenectady.
Magdalena, like Catrina in Gross
Anspach, feared the journey for her baby, and
with her husband crossed the river to the
older German settlement on the other side.
Like Catrina, she wept bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>When bundles had been packed by a silent,
pale Margareta, when John Conrad had already
lifted his pack to his shoulder, Fate,
which had played the Weisers many cruel
tricks, became suddenly friendly. A rowboat
grounded on the little beach and a young
man sprang out and hailed John Conrad, who
stared at him without answering. But the
young man did not wait for John Conrad's
slow mental processes; he hurried toward the
pale girl who gazed as though she saw a ghost.
A single joyful "Margareta!" made clear to
the settlement that Margareta's prayers had
been answered.</p>

<p>Now the starting must be delayed another
day. Across the river rowed Conrad to bring
Magdalena and her husband and the preacher
back with him; about the reunited lovers sat
all the Germans. Young Baer had a good
place and he had built a little house. He had
written many times, though no letter had
come from Margareta.</p>

<p>"It was the wicked agent who kept the
letters," said Margareta. "God be thanked
we are free from him!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Best of all, young Baer had seen Christopher
and George Frederick who lived not far
away.</p>

<p>"They are well cared for and happy, and
they look for their sister. Peter Zenger, who
lives near by, watches for her also."</p>

<p>At this all the tender-hearted Germans
wept once more. The parting from Margareta
was lightened by the expectation that
they would meet again. Once more the star
of hope shone brightly.</p>

<p>In the lodge of John Meyndert the Weisers
settled themselves in November. It was not
clean, but they could endure discomfort a
little longer. The chief difficulty was the
drunkenness of Meyndert, who had learned
the white man's evil habit.</p>

<p>From Meyndert John Conrad and his son
tried, in the long, idle hours, to learn the
Indian language. They hunted eagerly for
work in the settlement, but there was no work
to be had. With thankfulness John Conrad
accepted the offer of an Englishwoman to
take Sabina into service. The Indian lodge
was not a suitable home for either her or little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Barbara. At restless, unhappy Conrad his
father looked uneasily. Even the village of
Schenectady offered mischief to idle hands.</p>

<p>"You could teach the little children, lad,"
said he.</p>

<p>"I want a man's work," answered Conrad
sullenly.</p>

<p>Then, as in the London fog, Conrad had a
strange experience.</p>

<p>There was fog, also, here by the Mohawk
River, by which he walked early one November
morning. Again he went with head bent,
kicking the leaves and pebbles before him.
Again he felt that stubborn head strike an
obstacle and himself fly backward. When,
in amazement, he picked himself up, he was
confounded. There was no obstacle before
him. There was neither tree nor rock. Puzzled
and alarmed, he turned toward the settlement.
Presently he looked back. By this
time the mist had lifted, and behind him he
saw a gigantic Indian. Conrad stopped as
though his feet were weighted and the great
body, wrapped in a bright new blanket, bore
down upon him. The Indian grunted his queer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
"Ho, Ho," and motioned Conrad to lead the
way. That he had no unkindly intention was
made clear by the smile which his little trick
brought to his face.</p>

<p>At the first flat rock to which they came he
bade Conrad sit down. He drew from the
bundle which he carried on his shoulders a
loaf of Indian bread and broke off a large
piece.</p>

<p>"Eat," said he in the Mohawk language.
"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am John Conrad Weiser's son Conrad,"
answered Conrad, thankful for each moment
spent in learning the rudiments of John Meyndert's
language.</p>

<p>"To Weiser we gave a gift. Why does he
not come to take it?" This was the meaning
of the next sentence as nearly as Conrad could
guess.</p>

<p>"He will come in the springtime."</p>

<p>"And you?" The Indian looked earnestly
into Conrad's blue eyes, as though astonished
at their vivid color.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>yes</i>!" cried Conrad.</p>

<p>The Indian said no more, but rose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
walked toward the settlement, motioning
Conrad to follow. His long stride soon left
Conrad far behind and Conrad started to run,
to find a grinning Indian waiting for him behind
a tree, or calling to him from the rear.
Presently, when the Indian's ruse brought
them face to face, Conrad pointed to himself.</p>

<p>"I am Conrad," said he. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Quagnant," was the answer.</p>

<p>He it was who had given the Germans their
hearty welcome!</p>

<p>When they entered the settlement, Conrad
would have liked to follow the chief as he
went from Indian house to Indian house, but
he did not dare.</p>

<p>To Meyndert's lodge Quagnant came late
in the afternoon, and there sat himself down
on a pile of deerskins near the fire. He had
come, he said, to hold a conversation with the
white chief. At a sign from her husband, John
Meyndert's squaw rose and went away, beckoning
John Conrad's family to follow. For
an instant Conrad thought that he was to
remain. Then Quagnant, hitherto so kind,
pointed to him, and Meyndert bade him go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
also. Offended, Conrad did not return till
hunger drove him back after dark.</p>

<p>Then the family, except John Conrad, were
asleep; as Conrad lifted the curtain of skins
which hung across the door, his father rose
from beside the dying fire and led him outside.
In the starlight he walked up and down
with his hand on his boy's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Conrad, I have an offer to set before
you. I have kept you with me, both because
I could not find any opening for you and
because I could not bear to let you go. This
Indian Quagnant has asked me to let you go
with him to his village, there 'to learn to be a
man,' as he puts it. He means that they will
teach you how to hunt and trap and how
to make a home in the wilderness. Would
you like to enter on this strange apprenticeship?"</p>

<p>Conrad's full heart breathed a great sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"You cannot come back until spring. The
training in Indian ways may be very irksome."</p>

<p>"Not as irksome as idleness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>For an hour father and son talked, entering
once more upon the future with a tender recalling
of the past. Then they went to bed.</p>

<p>In the misty morning Conrad started away,
a little bundle on his back. He kissed the
sleeping Barbara, he put both arms about
his father's neck, then he followed the tall
Indian who walked before him, silent, mysterious,
his tall figure dim in the fog.</p>

<p>They crossed the wet meadow and walked
for an hour by the stream-side, then Quagnant
turned into the forest. They ascended
a rocky hill, they followed a narrow valley,
they climbed another hill. When the sun was
high in the sky, they ate a lunch of corn bread
and dried fish from Quagnant's pack. Then,
already footsore and stiff, Conrad followed
doggedly the long stride which led farther and
farther into the wilderness.</p>

THE DARK FOREST</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">At</span> nightfall the travelers camped in the
shelter of a huge boulder. Quagnant
made a fire by rubbing two sticks together;
then he spread the embers about and started
other fires close to the face of the rock. When
they had burned themselves out, he bade
Conrad lie down on the warmed ground.
Faintly aware that Quagnant went on with
some other device for making him comfortable,
Conrad slept.</p>

<p>In the morning he found that he lay in a tent
formed by the boughs of evergreens and that
he was still comfortably warm. Quagnant
had shot a bird which he was roasting over
the fire. When it was eaten and the fire was
tramped out, Quagnant shouldered his pack.
He looked up at the sky, shook his head, and
started briskly away.</p>

<p>Until noon Quagnant led the way across
rough hills and through narrow valleys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
While they ate their lunch, the snow began
to fall and Quagnant grunted his annoyance.
Soon the rocks were slippery and the trail
hard to find. There were other hills and other
valleys and another exhausted sleep at night.</p>

<p>On the third day, Conrad was certain that
he could not rise. Quagnant helped him up
and many times in the morning slackened
his pace or stopped entirely. In the afternoon
he stopped short and bade Conrad look
ahead. They had come round the shoulder of
a hill and were looking into a broad valley.
Here there had been no snow and the meadows
were green. Through the center of the
valley ran a stream, broad and full and
smoothly flowing.</p>

<p>"I see people!" cried Conrad. "They are
building houses!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Conrad's heart throbbed against
his side.</p>

<p>"Schoharie!" he cried. "Is this Schoharie?"</p>

<p>Quagnant grinned.</p>

<p>"Schoharie," he repeated.</p>

<p>Conrad tried to wave his hand, but could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
make only a feeble motion. He began to talk
in a queer, uncertain way, and Quagnant,
looking at him uneasily, took him by the
arm, and presently lifted him to his back. On
he went until at dusk he stepped into a path
worn into a deep rut. Ahead were lights and
the sound of voices.</p>

<p>When Conrad was allowed to slip from the
broad back to a soft pile of deerskins, he felt
that all the comforts he had ever known were
combined in one delicious sensation. That
Schoharie lay far behind him he did not
know: that the faces about him were dark,
the voices strange,&mdash;all were matters of
indifference. He felt the rim of a warm cup
against his lips, then he fell asleep.</p>

<p>The sun had been long in the sky when he
woke. He was in an oblong house of bark.
Through a hole in the roof the sun streamed
upon the ashes of a fire. On the walls hung
guns and bows and arrows and strange long
spears and about were piles of furs, on one of
which lay a little case of bark from which
there issued the scream of a hungry baby.</p>

<p>At once a young woman lifted the curtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
at the door. Before taking her baby, she
looked at Conrad, and finding him awake,
nodded and smiled. In a moment she brought
a wooden bowl filled with broth. Conrad
drained the bowl and lay back once more.</p>

<p>When, late in the afternoon, he lifted the
curtain, he found himself in a village of bark
houses. At the far end of the single street
children were playing, and from the ashes of
a fire a woman was taking a loaf of Indian
bread. She gave a little call and at once other
women appeared and the children came
closer.</p>

<p>"Where is Quagnant?" asked Conrad.</p>

<p>The women imitated the sighting of a gun
and pointed to their mouths. The children,
dressed in little coats and leggings of leather,
pointed with amazement to Conrad's fair skin
and then at their own dark cheeks. Finally
one came close to him.</p>

<p>"Eyes-like-the-Sky," said he, and his companions
repeated the strange name.</p>

<p>It was repeated again when the hunters
returned with deer meat, and there seemed to
be general satisfaction with the discernment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of the little boy whose own name was Young
Deer.</p>

<p>At once the women prepared the feast.
Portions of the meat were set aside to be
smoked; the rest was divided into slices and
broiled. There was no seasoning and the Indian
bread was coarse, but the meal was better
than many which the guest had eaten.</p>

<p>For a few days Conrad watched the play
of the children, who showed him haunts of
beaver and woodchuck, and taught him to
make and spin a heart-shaped top of wood.
With them he played Blind Man's Buff, in
which the bandage across his eyes was his
own dullness of vision which could not see
the little figure lying among the leaves. He
watched also the women braiding their baskets
and grinding earth into the paint for the
faces and bodies of their husbands.</p>

<p>In the evening he sat with the Indians in
Quagnant's house. At first their speech was
a strange jargon, but gradually the sounds
stayed in his mind and were associated with
the objects to which they belonged. The
comfortable nights in the chief's wigwam and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the good food put color into his cheeks and
flesh on his thin body.</p>

<p>But idleness and luxury did not long endure.
He had come to look upon the deerskins
which served him for a bed as his own.
One night, when he wished to lie down, they
were gone. He asked for them and was
laughed at.</p>

<p>"You have no deerskin," said Quagnant.</p>

<p>In the morning Quagnant gave him a gun
and led the way into the forest. Three days
later when they returned, Quagnant had two
deerskins and Conrad none. Again he slept
on the ground and again he went with Quagnant
into the forest. On the third journey he
shot a buck.</p>

<p>For one night after the skin was dressed, he
slept upon it in the chief's house. At the next
nightfall he found himself and his bed thrust
outside. The Indians laughed at his astonishment
and every laugh said, "Make a house
for yourself!"</p>

<p>With the advice and aid of the children,
Conrad built himself a wigwam. At once
Quagnant demolished it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wind come&mdash;house gone. Eyes-like-the-Sky
can do better."</p>

<p>When his house was finished to Quagnant's
satisfaction, Conrad had a few days of peace.
Then for a day he was allowed no food; then
for two days; then for three. He was taken
to a distant point in the forest and required
to find his way home. One bitter day he was
dropped into a deep, icy pond in a near-by
stream.</p>

<p>As he understood more of the language, he
listened earnestly to the talk of the older
Indians. Through all ran the consciousness
of danger,&mdash;distant, perhaps, but real.
Sometimes messengers from other tribes appeared
suddenly in the village. Painted,
armed, terrible, they talked always of the bow
and the string, the long line of the French
whom they called Onotio, and the shorter line
of English whom they called Onas.</p>

<p>"Upon Onas Onotio will make war. When
we walk in the forest we hear it shouted by
the trees. We will all ally ourselves with
Onas."</p>

<p>When there came to the village those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
would exterminate all pale-faces, Quagnant
hurried Conrad out of the way. In January
five great chiefs came to visit Quagnant.
Conrad gazed at them earnestly, hoping to
see the King of Rivers. They looked back at
him scowling and muttering, and Conrad retreated
to his wigwam.</p>

<p>The chiefs went to Quagnant's house, and
before them the women placed broiled venison
and wild turkey. Afterwards long pipes
were solemnly smoked. Then Quagnant gave
a command to Little Squaw into whose eyes
came a frightened look. Quagnant saw her
hesitate.</p>

<p>"Go!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Hidden away in the cache of Quagnant,
where there was now little else, there were a
few black bottles, paid to him in return for
many beautiful skins carried to Schenectady.
Little Squaw fetched them as she was
bidden.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night Conrad heard the
sound of carousing and looked out. The fire-water
had done its evil work, and the Indians
sought some victim upon whom to spend their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
madness. There was a flash of steel and past
Conrad's head flew a sharp axe. Other weapons
flashed in the moonlight. Terrified, without
blanket or other extra covering, Conrad
fled into the forest.</p>

<p>Two days later in a blinding snowstorm he
ventured to return. Whether Quagnant remembered
his behavior it was difficult to tell.
His visitors had gone, and he sat, sullen and
miserable, beside the fire in the wigwam, making
no answer to the complaints of Little
Squaw.</p>

<p>"The cache is almost empty," said she.
"All the summer I labored and now you have
given large presents to the Oneidas. I saw
them go heavily laden. Now we will have a
great storm when no hunting can be done."</p>

<p>The first day of the snowstorm Conrad
spent in repairing the damage to his wigwam.
He thought of his father and his brothers and
sisters, and wondered once more, in deep depression,
to what goal his wanderings would
bring him. At nightfall he ate the last of his
food.</p>

<p>It was still dark when he woke in the morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ing;
at least no light came through the chinks
of the wigwam or through the opening at the
top. Stiff and sore, he turned and slept. When
he woke again, he sprang up and went to lift
the curtain at the door. To his amazement
he looked into darkness. When he thrust out
his hand he discovered that it was not night
which surrounded him, but a wall of snow,
higher than the wigwam.</p>

<p>He was not at first alarmed. He had heard
more than one story of imprisonment for days
while the great snows fell. The snow was
porous, and the wigwams, thus blanketed,
were warm. He had, it was true, no food, but
he could go without food for a day or two.
He was still not thoroughly rested and he
would sleep.</p>

<p>He was wakened by what sounded like the
report of a gun. His heart failed. Perhaps
Quagnant's friends had come back and were
prepared to finish the work which they had
threatened! Again there came the sharp explosion.
Now Conrad remembered the cold
nights of the great frost in Gross Anspach
when the trees had cracked like pistols. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
snow must have ceased to fall and rescue
would soon come.</p>

<p>In the morning his mind was not clear. He
heard a whistling sound in the top of the wigwam
and saw a pale light filtering in. Deep
drifts must be forming.</p>

<p>"It will be best to stay here," said he
heavily.</p>

<p>As the hours passed he fell into a stupor.
The wind died, the light of sunset showed for
a few minutes in a yellow haze at the top of
the wigwam, and once more through the long
night the trees cracked like pistols.</p>

<p>Quagnant and his squaw and their large
brood got comfortably through the three days
of imprisonment. Quagnant grew mild and
peaceable; he told stories to the children and
obeyed his wife. But when she ordered him to
go and dig Conrad out, he sent several young
Indians in his place. The recollection of the
flying hatchet disturbed him.</p>

<p>"I will drink no more fire-water," he promised
himself solemnly.</p>

<p>Run-as-the-Wind and Turkey Feather and
Young Deer all worked diligently with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
hoes which they borrowed from their mothers.
As they approached the door of the wigwam
they cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eyes-like-the-Sky! Wake up! Wake up!"</p>

<p>When there was no answer they worked
faster.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Eyes-like-the-Sky had no food!"</p>

<p>"A bear might have devoured him as he
slept!"</p>

<p>"He is brave; he would kill the bear."</p>

<p>When they had reached the door of the
wigwam and still Conrad did not answer, the
rescuing party grew very quiet. Little Squaw
was the first to thrust her head through the
hole which the boys made.</p>

<p>"He lies here like the snow itself! Quick!
some hot broth from Quagnant's kettle!"</p>

<p>With a wooden spoon she forced a few
drops through Conrad's lips, then a little
more. Then she sent Turkey Feather to
Quagnant.</p>

<p>"Tell Quagnant a good bed is to be made
by the fire. Tell him Little Squaw sends him
this and this." And Little Squaw picked up
the hatchets of Quagnant and his friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>That night the Mohawk village feasted
again. Relieved by the ending of the storm
and the restoration of Conrad, the squaws
forgot the alarming emptiness of each family
cache.</p>

<p>The snow thawed little by little. When a
crust formed, it was not thick enough to bear
the weight of the hunters. Food grew more
scarce and the usual two meals a day dwindled
to one. Another heavy snow made hunting
impossible. More sullen grew the warriors,
more angry the squaws, more miserable
the little children.</p>

<p>After the second great snow a crust formed
and Quagnant started at once into the forest,
taking Conrad with him. The two crossed the
hill which lay toward the west and followed
the next valley to the north. It was bitterly
cold; insufficiently clad and weak from lack
of food, Conrad trudged along, his heart
heavy, his mind dull. To him now the new
country was a trap in which all the Germans
would be finally lost. Quagnant did not
speak except to give sullen orders. At nightfall
the two camped supperless and without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
shelter. There was now no warming of a bed,
since the wood lay deep under the snow.</p>

<p>When the two took up their weary journey,
it seemed to Conrad that Quagnant tried
deliberately to court death. He climbed another
western hill, and his voice became more
gruff. Was it possible that he meant to lead
Conrad far away and desert him? Then there
would be one less mouth in the Indian village.</p>

<p>The sun was high when they came to the
top of the hill. Another valley lay before
them with a swift, dark stream flowing through
its center. Another hill rose opposite. Conrad
wondered drearily whether his numb feet
must climb that also.</p>

<p>"I wish that the end would come soon,"
said he bitterly. "I wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>Walking heedlessly as he had walked on
the Schenectady meadow, Conrad came with
a thump into the same obstacle. Before him
Quagnant had stopped rigid. Terrified, Conrad
looked up. Quagnant was staring down
into the valley, where along the stream beside
a deep pool a small herd of deer nibbled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
green laurel leaves. They were almost motionless
and they were within easy shot.</p>

<p>Quagnant pulled the trigger and a deer
dropped. His comrades lifted their heads,
but before they could dash away in terror
another fell. The flight of the remainder soon
ended. Before them the stream plunged over
a precipice; on both sides the icy walls rose
steeply. A third and a fourth fell before
Quagnant's accurate shots. There was a glow
on his dark cheeks, a fire in his black eyes.
He took a step to one side and pulled the
trigger again.</p>

<p>Then, in spite of the silence to which he
had been trained, Quagnant gave a fierce yell.
He had gone a little too near the edge of the
steep slope. His feet slipped as the gun recoiled
and he slid, making frantic efforts to
regain his footing.</p>

<p>But his efforts were vain. With increasing
speed he coasted down the hillside, his course
leading straight toward the rocky wall which
dropped abruptly for at least fifty feet. It
was as though an insect should slip down the
side of a cup with sure drowning in the bot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>tom.
Then, near the brink of the pool, a bush
caught the pack on his shoulders and held him
suspended.</p>

<p>Now Quagnant was silent. The deer thongs
which bound the pack were strong, but his
body was heavy. He could see below him the
black pool. In its icy water he might keep
himself afloat for a few seconds, but to climb
out would be impossible. Across the stream
he could see the bodies of the slain deer, food
for all his people, and he could hear the snow
crust breaking as the others made their
escape. Conrad, far above him in safety, he
could not see.</p>

<p>Quagnant shut his eyes and listened to the
gurgle of the water and looked into his poor
Indian soul. The logic of the case was simple.
He could not move without help, and Conrad
would not help him. He had abused the pale-face
and the pale-face would certainly desert
him. Even if there were mercy in his heart,
Conrad could not come down the hill without
risking his life nor return to the village for
help before Quagnant would die of cold.</p>

<p>Then Quagnant heard above the gurgle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the water a strange sound as though some one
were following his wild flight. There was the
sound of sliding feet, then silence, then again
the sound of sliding feet. Presently began a
sharp chip, chip, as though the ice were being
struck with a hatchet. Quagnant, with eyes
still closed, began to address the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>"I pray that I may not be cut off from my
present life, Great and Good Spirit."</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the sound of chipping;
higher and higher rose the hopes of
Quagnant. It would be fearful, indeed, to slip
over the precipice with rescue at hand! But
was it rescue? Quagnant remembered again
with sickening pain the sharp hatchet hurled
at Conrad. It was that very hatchet which
Conrad held in his hand!</p>

<p>Now Quagnant could feel each stroke on
the ice. They were near his head&mdash;he gave
himself up. They had passed his head and
were even with his waist&mdash;he dared to
breathe again. When the chipping had
sounded for a long time beside his foot, he felt
a hand touch his foot and move it to a hole
in the ice in which it could find support. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
aided, he was able to lift his arms and draw
himself up beside the little bush. Near by,
supporting himself by a tree, sat Conrad.</p>

<p>With immobile countenance and without
even his customary grunt, Quagnant climbed
the mountain in the tracks which Conrad had
made. After he had rested for a few minutes
and had ceased to tremble, he walked along
the ridge until he found an easy descent to
the stream and to the carcases of the deer. He
did not speak until he had dressed a portion
of the meat with his long knife and cooked
it over a little fire of driftwood which had
been carried high on the bank where it had
been protected by thick laurel and hemlock
shrubbery. This he would not touch until
Conrad had eaten. Then at last he spoke.</p>

<p>"A cloud had come between us, Conrad,
and the skies were dark. It is past now forever
and the skies are clear."</p>

<p>Hiding in the stream, away from the sharp
claws of panther or wildcat, the meat which
they could not carry, the two set out for home.
The next day the hunters brought in, not only
Quagnant's kill, but three more deer. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
evening Conrad was invited to the feast of the
grown men and was given a long pipe. He did
not like the strong tobacco, but he did his
best to smoke, aware that he had been paid
a great honor. At him Quagnant looked
solemnly, both during the feast and afterwards
when they sat together by the fire. In
Quagnant's mind was taking shape a strange
plan, at once brilliant and cunning. If Conrad
could have looked into the chief's mind and
could have seen there, slowly forming, the
last episode in his strange apprenticeship, he
might well have been terrified. The meeting
in the London fog was about to bear its fruit.</p>

<p>At last the sullen winter was past and
the trees began to bud and the meadows to
grow green. The women prepared their little
patches of ground for maize and potatoes,
old canoes were mended and new canoes were
built, the young men began to court and the
maidens to grow more shy. When Conrad
spoke of joining his father, who must be by
this time in Schoharie, Quagnant shook his
head.</p>

<p>"You have been with us through the cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
winter: you cannot leave when the Great
Spirit is making all things beautiful."</p>

<p>Now dark forms glided through the forest
once more, as though there were perpetual
patrol in its dim aisles. Messengers came to
the village, messengers were sent away. The
Mohawks spoke of their country as the Long
House whose back was at the Hudson River
and whose door was Niagara. In the spring
weather all the inhabitants were astir.</p>

<p>One morning, at dawn, Conrad felt a touch
on his shoulder and sprang up as he had been
trained. Quagnant stood before him, enormous
in the pale light. In his hand he held
a new suit of doeskin and a bowl of the red
paint with which his tribe painted stars and
turtles on their cheeks. With a few strokes he
decorated Conrad's tanned face. Together
they ate and upon the shoulder of each Little
Squaw fastened a pack of food and a blanket.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Conrad.</p>

<p>Quagnant made no answer except to motion
Conrad to follow him through the village.
There, with his long stride, Quagnant
took up the trail toward the southwest.</p>

JOURNEY'S END</h2>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> would be difficult to tell which fared the
worse during the long winter, the Germans
who had forced their way to the Schoharie
Valley in November, or those who remained,
like John Conrad, in the settlements. All were
poor, all were ill-clad, all were insufficiently
fed. The cruel winter continued the weeding-out
of the weak. At Schoharie the Indians
helped the newcomers according to their
promise, and what food and furs they could
spare they gave cheerfully.</p>

<p>In March, John Conrad and all those who
had remained started to Schoharie. There
were indications of an early spring, and it was
important that crops should be sown. From
Conrad nothing had been heard and his father
grew daily more anxious. Sabina, like Margareta
and Magdalena, had found a mate, and
Barbara had taken her place with the kind
Englishwoman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner had the journey begun than the
last of the winter's storms was upon the
little party. Little children died and grown
persons suffered cruelly. Joined with their
friends at Schoharie in the valley of their
dreams, the pilgrims waited, with what patience
they could summon, for spring.</p>

<p>When, finally, the snow had melted for the
last time and the meadows were growing
green and the willows were yellow along the
river, the hearts of the Germans rested at
last. The lovely valley was lovelier than their
dreams. Log houses were built, farms were
laid out, and with their poor tools they
prepared to create a German valley which
should bloom like the rose.</p>

<p>Still no word of Conrad was to be had. He
was in the village of Quagnant to the west&mdash;that
the Indians knew, but they could tell no
more. His father grew more and more anxious
and unhappy. As he worked the soil, he
lifted his head to watch; when his day's work
was done, he walked into the forest toward
the west.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as Conrad followed the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
stride of Quagnant through the budding
forest, he remembered the weary journey in
November from Schenectady to the Indian
village. Then he had nearly perished with
exhaustion; now he walked without weariness.
Quagnant remembered also and commented
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Eyes-like-the-Sky does not stumble or
faint. He is a true Indian."</p>

<p>"This is a smooth trail."</p>

<p>In Indian fashion Quagnant made a comparison.</p>

<p>"That was a smooth trail, but to Eyes-like-the-Sky
it was unfamiliar. The heart of the
Indian seemed also strange to you, but now
it is plain."</p>

<p>As the two sat by a little camp-fire in the
cool evenings, Quagnant looked solemnly at
Conrad. They had now many companions;
tall chiefs wrapped in blankets and stalking
solemnly, young men heavily armed and
thickly painted. The strangers stared at Conrad
in amazement, their keen eyes piercing
the thick layer of paint with which his cheeks
were covered. When Conrad glanced back at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
them, they looked at his eyes and shook
their heads. They talked with Quagnant of
the Long House, of distant enemies whom
they called the Lenape, and of other matters
which Conrad did not understand. It was
clearly evident that Conrad's presence startled
and shocked them.</p>

<p>Presently Quagnant grew communicative.
One evening when he and Conrad camped
alone, he told him something of the affairs of
the Indians.</p>

<p>"The Five Nations are at peace, but they
will not always be at peace. Many important
things are coming to pass, Conrad."</p>

<p>It was in the middle of a bright May morning
that Quagnant and his companion reached
the end of their journey. The trail led over
the last stream, through the last wood and
thence to a great hill, upon whose side lay a
large Indian village. Here it was that the
hundreds of small human streams had converged;
here the savages were gathered, it
seemed to Conrad, in an innumerable host.
At sight of them, his heart throbbed and his
skin pricked with fright. Quagnant's face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
was hideous, and here Quagnant was repeated
hundreds of times. Quagnant's great body,
crowned with its bristling eagle feathers, was
a bit terrifying even to Conrad, and here was
Quagnant's fierce strength multiplied by a
great army. There were Indians wrapped in
blankets, Indians without covering, Indians
with hideous nose-rings, and here and there
shamans or medicine men with masks of animals,
as though the very beasts of the forest
had come to join the council.</p>

<p>When strength returned to Conrad's frightened
heart, he breathed a frantic prayer to be
allowed to escape. For such a scene as this no
experience of his life had prepared him. But
he dared not show a sign of fear; he must walk
on behind Quagnant, up the street of the
village between the gigantic creatures and
before the black, beady, piercing eyes. As
Quagnant approached, he was hailed with
many a loud "Ho, Ho." The sound which
followed him was different,&mdash;a low, disapproving
murmur.</p>

<p>Straight up the great hill led the feet of
Quagnant; close to him followed Conrad. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the summit of the hill the forest trees had
been cut in a wide circle and the ground had
been beaten like a hard floor. About the rim
of the circle were placed tree-stumps and
logs; in the middle burned a fire, round which
crouched shamans, more hideous than the
warriors. Beside them lay their drums of
tightly stretched skin and their rattles of
turtle shell or gourd. They sat motionless,
their eyes upon the fire.</p>

<p>Quagnant bade Conrad sit down at the
edge of the woods, and himself sat beside
him. One by one Indians came to speak to
him, to Conrad a consoling sign of his importance.
Longest of all he spoke with an
Oneida chief named Shikellamy. What they
said Conrad could not hear, but he could see
that Shikellamy looked upon him kindly.</p>

<p>"He has a great heart and a wise mind,"
said Quagnant as the chief went away. "In
council he makes our way clear."</p>

<p>At noon the shamans beat their drums and
shook their rattles, and at once, breaking off
conversation with one another or with the
squaws of the village, the Indians approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the council fire. Certain ones, Quagnant and
Shikellamy among them, took seats together
on the tree-stumps; the others sat on logs or
on the ground. Outside the circle stood scores
of young men. Presently the shamans ceased
to beat their drums and shake their rattles
and crouched again about the fire.</p>

<p>Now followed a period of complete silence.
The chiefs did not move; the young warriors
seemed scarcely to breathe; even from the
village came no sound of speech and no cry
of child.</p>

<p>Shikellamy was the first to rise. He spoke
in a deep voice and was listened to with
breathless attention.</p>

<p>"Brothers of the Long House, it is now
many years since the great tree was planted
under whose young roots we buried our
hatchets. Many moons have risen and waned
since we wove our wampum into one belt.
Many feasts have been eaten since the undying
flame of our council fire was lighted, and
since Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga, Oneida,
and Cayuga became brothers. The great tree
will continue to grow, the sun and moon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
rise and the council fire to send out into the
forest its clear light. Our hatchets, buried in
the ground, will rust before they are dug
up.</p>

<p>"We are now at peace with all men, and
strangers seek our favor. Our enemies fear us
and we fear no one.</p>

<p>"But, brothers of the Long House, there
are matters to be considered. Claims have
been laid against us. Our young men, in the
heat of anger and inflamed by drink, have
done here and there a little injury. The tears
of those whom they injured must be wiped
away with presents. Each wrong must be
considered and we must make recompense
without grudging.</p>

<p>"These matters are, however, small. Our
brother Onotio has something to say to us.
Our brother Onas has also something to say
to us. Between Onotio on the one side and
Onas on the other, there is undying hatred,
whose cause is shut off from our eyes. We
cannot remain friends both to Onotio and to
Onas, who draw nearer and nearer to one another
through the forests. Soon the two black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
clouds will meet, and the grass on the warpath
will be trodden down.</p>

<p>"It is for the consideration of these matters
that the council is assembled."</p>

<p>When Shikellamy had finished a loud uproar
was made by the medicine men. They
rose and faced the east, then prostrated themselves
again and again. The Great Spirit was
being invoked.</p>

<p>Now with astonishing order the various
businesses of which Shikellamy had spoken
were presented to the council and settled.
The young Indians who had quarreled with
their neighbors were admonished and fined.
Young Eagle was to send five deerskins to dry
the tears of the warrior whose son he had
injured; Short Arm was to send three blankets
to the widow of the man whom he had killed.
Against these decisions there was no protest.
The code which the young men had disobeyed
was clearly understood and its penalties accepted
without argument.</p>

<p>When the relations of the allied nations to
the French and English came to be spoken of,
there was a change in the spirit of the meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>ing.
Now all whispering ceased; every one
sat motionless, listening with knitted brows
and bright, eager eyes. The council was informed
minutely of the affairs of the English
colonies to the east and the French settlements
to the west. Conrad listened as eagerly
as the rest, his terror lost in amazement.</p>

<p>"I am a swift runner," said Short Arm.
"I went in three days to Harris's Ferry. The
children of Brother Onas are creeping, creeping
to the west and to the north. They are
coming into the Long House. They are grazing
their cattle where our deer have grazed.
They are our enemies."</p>

<p>"The pale-faces are in Schoharie," said a
dark-faced, hideously painted old chief. As
he spoke he pointed at Conrad. "Not only
are they given lands, but they are taken into
our wigwams. They are our enemies."</p>

<p>From some one came a sneering laugh.
Now Conrad was sure of what would be his
fate. Then, on the opposite side of the council
fire, a tall figure rose. Conrad's lips parted;
he was about to cry out; then he held his lips
closely shut with his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is the King of Rivers! It is the King of
Rivers!"</p>

<p>"This talk about the children of Onas is
nonsense. The children of Onotio are more
hateful. They come into the Long House
from the north. They think nothing of their
promises. They have allied themselves with
our enemies; they are our enemies. There are
no two words about them."</p>

<p>Now Quagnant rose, and standing with
folded arms looked about until he had met
every piercing eye. Last of all he sought
the wide blue ones at the edge of the forest.
Like the other Indians, Quagnant spoke eloquently.</p>

<p>"Brothers, we are of the extended lodge.
The Long House is no mere hut like the
dwelling of the Catawbas. We have made
our enemies to flutter like frightened young
birds. At the Catawbas and the Lenape we
laugh.</p>

<p>"Now strangers seek to live with us in the
Long House,&mdash;a great people, pale of face,
with new customs and long guns. Some are
our friends, some are our enemies. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
brought us good things and bad things. With
the guns they have brought we have become
powerful, but with the fire-water they have
brought we have become mad.</p>

<p>"We cannot tell which among these pale-faces
are our friends. Their words are not
ours and their faces are not ours. They give
little in exchange for much. Our furs are to
them no more valuable than a few beads, our
hunting-grounds no more than a few hatchets."</p>

<p>"It is a good day's journey from the Susquehanna
to the Black Mountain," cried a
voice. "This they have taken for a piece of
bright cloth and a glass in which to see one's
face!"</p>

<p>"Their traders lie to us!" cried another.</p>

<p>The hideously painted old chief rose.</p>

<p>"Year by year their ships come. They
overrun our land, given by the Great Spirit.
They enter at the front of the Long House to
shove us out at the back; at the back, to push
us out at the front. I counsel death to all!"</p>

<p>A great trembling seized upon Conrad.
Then he saw that Quagnant still stood, mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>tionless,
waiting to continue his speech. Quagnant
would not forget the icy bank and the
deep pool!</p>

<p>"Brothers," said Quagnant, "let us be orderly
in council, not like chattering birds.
The words of Quagnant were not finished."</p>

<p>At once silence was restored.</p>

<p>"The various brothers have spoken," went
on Quagnant. "Many have spoken without
thought. They desire war, without reflecting
that the pale-face has long guns also, without
reflecting that ships will bring new pale-faces.
There is a pale-face to whom I have put many
questions; he tells me that they are across the
sea like the leaves of the forest. To talk of
making war upon all is child's talk.</p>

<p>"What we should do, brothers of the Long
House, is to enter into understanding with
the pale-face, so that we may say, 'To this
river the land is yours, beyond is ours.' Then
our mind will be clear to them, then messengers
can go to and fro and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They will not listen!" cried the old warrior.
"They have laughed our messengers in
the face."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Quagnant waited again until the old warrior
had been frowned at by half the assemblage.
Quagnant approached now the carefully
planned climax of his address.</p>

<p>"The pale-faces will not listen to us, it is
true. They do not understand us. But they
will listen to another pale-face. I have had
in my wigwam a young pale-face. I have
watched his behavior. He has done things
which will move the hearts of the brothers of
the Long House when I tell them. I will tell
them at length. We have made of him an
Indian. He speaks our words. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now the fierce old warrior would not be
stayed. He sprang to his feet, hatchet in
hand.</p>

<p>"He may well speak our words when he
sits at our councils! Such a thing has never
been heard of in the Long House. Let him go
away and go quickly."</p>

<p>Shikellamy crossed the open space toward
Quagnant.</p>

<p>"Let the young braves take him away,"
said he.</p>

<p>At once Conrad found himself surrounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Down the hillside he was led and to the far
end of a long meadow through which flowed a
stream.</p>

<p>There, when the curiosity of the young Indians
about what was going on in the council
could be no longer resisted, he was left alone.
He could hear on the rising wind the sound
of many voices and now a single voice raised
in impassioned speech. About him the shades
of the spring night were falling and a cold
breath from the water chilled him through.
Hungry and tired, he sat with his hands
clasped round his knees and his cheek bent
upon them. The forest seemed to press upon
him. A more terrible oppression came from
the thought of the savage creatures on the hillside,
gathered from the wilderness, debating
now whether to deal with the whites in peace
or to exterminate them with knife and flame.</p>

<p>He thought of his father's dreams of a great
country where there should be liberty and
peace. With honesty and at the same time
with firmness must these children of the wilderness
be met or dreams and their dreamers
would perish in a night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently a dark form stole toward him
across the meadow. He heard a strange singing
unlike the voice of man or animal. He saw
strange forms approach; with faces masked and
bodies wrapped in skins of deer and panther
and bear. He moved to the nearest tree and
stood with his back against it. He thought
now no more of his father's dreams, or of God's
purpose of which his father talked, but prayed
in his pious German way that he might meet
his death bravely.</p>

<p>He found himself taken by the hand and
led up the hill, the strange forms following
after. Through the Indian village where the
women stared from firelit doorways, and
where over great fires meat was cooking, to
the center of the council he was taken, and
there he was placed alone beside the council
fire. About sat the chiefs, behind them in the
shadowy circle the young men. Conrad stood
still, his eyes seeking Quagnant. If death
should come, he hoped its messenger would be
a swift knife. The medicine men were behind
him; it would be by their hands that the blow
would be struck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Shikellamy was the first to speak. Upon
his magnificent body the firelight danced.
His immobile face told nothing of his heart,
but it seemed to Conrad that his voice was
kind.</p>

<p>"We have listened to the story of our
brother Quagnant," said he. "We believe
that you are honest and true. We believe
that you speak our words. In order that we
may bind ourselves to you and you to us"&mdash;now
Conrad's heart stood still&mdash;"in order
that we may bind ourselves to you and you to
us, we make you a member of the Five Nations.
We give you our heart and you give
us your heart. He who is our friend is your
friend. He who is our enemy is your enemy.
We invite you to the extended lodge, we bid
you come to our feasts. We will give you in
token deerskins to make you clothes and
shoes."</p>

<p>Now there was a long pause. The rising
wind moaned in the pine trees, the fire
leaped. Shikellamy crossed to the council fire
and held out his great hand.</p>

<p>"We give you also in token a new name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
'Eyes-like-the-Sky' you are to the children,
but among men you are, 'He-holds-our-fate.'"</p>

<p>Now the King of Rivers came forward. A
true Indian, he gave no sign that he recollected
the camp of Blackheath and the
strange encounter which reached now its
stranger consummation.</p>

<p>"We are to see dark sights," said he. "I
see wars, with Indians creeping upon pale-faces
and pale-faces upon Indians. I hear
cries to the Great Spirit. See that you, who
are now our Tongue, are true to us. Then the
English will conquer the French and the land
will have peace. Between the Indian and the
English is a bond. You are that bond."</p>

<p>Now Shikellamy spoke again.</p>

<p>"You will have a great name while you
live, and after you die your Indian brothers
will visit the place where you lie. Your children
will say with pride, 'I am of the great
He-holds-our-fate, his blood is mine, I have
his brave heart.' Will you be true to your
brothers?"</p>

<p>"I will be true to my brothers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, at the side of a beckoning Quagnant,
Conrad sat down.</p>

<p>"You have done well," said Quagnant.
"Now the feast begins."</p>

<p>Conrad made no answer. He saw the Long
House, enormous, mysterious; he saw the
little fringe of white faces between it and the
sea. He saw the hopes and fears of the dwellers
in the Long House and the hopes and
fears of the strangers. Both were in his own
heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In June, John Conrad's eager, anxious eyes
were satisfied. He still walked each evening
into the forest. There on a fallen tree he sat
and looked toward the west. One clear evening,
he saw coming toward him an erect,
alert young Indian and sprang up to make the
same eager inquiry with which he greeted all
Indians. Then he stood still. The Indian was
clad in doeskin, his hair was long, his feet
were moccasined&mdash;but his eyes were blue!</p>

<p>"My son!" cried John Conrad.</p>

<p>Hand in hand the two sat down on the
fallen tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are my brothers and sisters?" asked
Conrad.</p>

<p>"I have heard no ill news of them. Sabina
is married, and Barbara has taken her place
with a kind mistress in Schenectady. Of all
my dear children you are left me, Conrad.
What has befallen you?"</p>

<p>Conrad talked steadily and quietly. He
was different; his eyes were steady, his figure
erect, his voice deep. He told of the strange
life, of the harsh training, of the bitter suffering
from hunger and cold.</p>

<p>When he described the council, John Conrad
shivered.</p>

<p>"A thousand times I wished I had not let
you go!" Then in the gathering dusk his eyes
sought his son's face. "What are you going
to do now, Conrad?"</p>

<p>Conrad turned and smiled into the anxious
eyes.</p>

<p>"I am going to help you and I am going to
teach the children their letters. Father,"&mdash;Conrad
looked back into the darkening woods,&mdash;"the
life among the Indians seems already
like a dream; but there they are waiting, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
fearful menace to us all. Suppose that I
should some day be the one to keep the peace!
Perhaps God has saved me for that through
much danger and perversity."</p>

<p>John Conrad breathed a long sigh. He
did not look into the future, but into the
past.</p>

<p>"Your mother and I could not give our
children riches and honor," said he slowly.
"We tried to give them faith in God and willingness
to do their simple duty. If you have
learned those lessons from us or in the forest
among the Indians, you are at last a man.
Your mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>But John Conrad could not finish, needed
not to finish. The hand within his tightened
and an arm was thrown across his bent
shoulders. Together the two sat silently, as
they had stood long ago in Gross Anspach in
the moonlight by the little church. Their
thoughts traveled together from sister to sister
and brother to brother, and finally back
once more across the sea. Then, at last, John
Conrad spoke.</p>

<p>"It has been a long journey and a weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
one," said he, "but my children will have a
better chance than I in the world. There
may be other journeys before me, but tonight
my heart is at rest."</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
